<h2><small>THE</small><br />
<a id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Opinion of there being a North-west Passage between
the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Southern Ocean</i> hath continued for more
than two Centuries; and though the Attempts made to discover
this Passage have not been attended with the desired Success, yet
in Consequence of such Attempts great Advantages have been received,
not by the Merchant only but by the Men of Science. It
must be a Satisfaction to the Adventurer, though disappointed
in his principal Design, that his Labours have contributed to the
Improvement of Science, and the Advancement of Commerce.</p>

<p>There was a Generosity with respect to the Discovery of a
North-west Passage, or a Respect to the great Abilities of those
who promoted the various Undertakings for making such Discovery,
to the Crown which patronized them, and the Estates
of the Kingdom who promised a most munificent Reward to such
who should compleat such Discovery, that those who were of a
contrary Opinion treated the Subject with a becoming Decency.
But the Censures that have been of late made by our Countrymen,
and more particularly by Foreigners, our Ancestors have
been treated as so many Fools, or infatuated Persons, busied to
compleat an impracticable and a merely chimerical Project, and
are accused by a foreign Geographer to have proceeded so far as
to forge a fictitious Account under the Title of a Letter of Admiral
<i>de Fonte</i>. That the Iniquity of the <i>English</i> Writers is not
such (neither was ever known to be such) nor, was it in their
Inclination, could they so easily deceive the World; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
Falshood of this Assertion could be no otherway made apparent
than by considering such Letter with a just Criticism, and examining
the Circumstances relating thereto. Though the present
Age may not pay much Regard to these Censures, yet if they are
passed unnoticed, might hereafter be considered as Truths unanswerable
at the Time those Censures were made. Therefore to
do Justice to the Character of our Ancestors, to the present Age
in which such great Encouragement hath been given to these Undertakings,
and that Posterity might not be deceived, were Motives
(had they been duly considered without a Regard to the
Importance of the Subject) which might incite an abler Pen to
have undertaken to vindicate the Authenticity of <i>de Fonte</i>'s Letter.
As for a long Time nothing of this Kind appeared, nor could I
hear that any Thing was undertaken of this Sort, by any Person
to whom I could freely communicate my Sentiments, and the Informations
which I had collected on this Subject, as the Discovery
of a North-west Passage hath been the Object of my Attention
for some Years, considered myself under the disagreeable Necessity
of becoming an Author in an Age of such refined Sentiments,
expressed in the greatest Purity of Language: But if I have succeeded
in the greater Matters, I hope to be excused in the lesser.</p>

<p>I have inserted the Letter of <i>de Fonte</i>, as first published in the
<cite>Monthly Miscellany</cite>, or <cite>Memoirs of the Curious</cite>, in <i>April</i> and <i>June</i>
1708, very scarce or in very few Hands; not only as I thought it
consistent with my Work, but that the Curious would be glad
to have a Copy of such Letter exactly in the same Manner in
which it was first published, to keep in their Collections.</p>

<p>As to the Observations respecting the Circumstances of the
Letter of <i>de Fonte</i>, the Manner by which it was attained, its being
a Copy of such Letter which the Editors procured to be translated
from the <i>Spanish</i>, and as to such Matters as are to be collected
from the Title of such Letter, and from the Letter in Support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
of its Authenticity, I submit those Observations to superior
Judgments: If confuted, and it appears I have misapprehended
the Matter, am not tenacious of my Opinion, but shall receive
the Conviction with Pleasure, being entirely consistent with my
Design, which is, That the Truth may be discovered, whether
this Account is authentick or not.</p>

<p>In my Remarks of the Letter I have endeavoured to distinguish
what was genuine, from what hath been since added by other
Hands; have made an exact Calculation of the Courses; have
considered the Circumstances of such Letter, giving the Reasons
of the Conduct that was used in the various Parts of the Voyage,
and shewing the Regularity and Consistency there is through the
Whole, and without Anachronisms or Contradictions as hath been
objected, part of which I was the better enabled to do from some
Experience which I have had in Affairs of this Sort. I must observe,
the Calculations were made without any Regard had to the
Situation of <i>Hudson</i>'s or <i>Baffin</i>'s Bay; but begun at the <i>Callao</i> of
<i>Lima</i>, and pursued as the Account directs from the Westward:
And it was an agreeable Surprize to find what an Agreement there
was as to the Parts which, by such Courses, it appeared that the
Admiral and his Captain were in, consistent with the Purpose they
were sent on, and the Proximity of where they were to <i>Hudson</i>'s
and <i>Baffin</i>'s Bay.</p>

<p>To state particularly all the Objections which have been made
to this Account, I thought would have greatly increased the Bulk
of the Work. There is no material Objection which I have any
where met with, but is here considered. Also to have added all
the Authorities which I have collected and made Use of, would
have made it more prolix; so have contented myself with only
giving such Quotations as appeared absolutely necessary to insert
and then to mention the Authors particularly. I think I have
not perverted the Meaning, or forced the Sense, of any Author
made Use of, to serve my Purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<p>To shew the Probability of a Passage, have traced the Opinions
relating to it from the Time such Opinions were first received;
and also determined where it was always supposed to be or
in what Part such Passage was: Have considered the various Evidence
that there is relating to such Passage; and proposed what
appears to be the properest Method at present for prosecuting
the Discovery.</p>

<p>There are three Maps, all of which appeared necessary for the
better understanding this Account. The one contains Part of
<i>Asia</i> and the <i>Russian</i> Discoveries on the Coast of <i>America</i>; the Expedition
of <i>de Fonte</i>, and clears up that seeming Inconsistency of
the<i>Tartarian</i> and <i>Southern Ocean</i> being contiguous in that Part
of <i>America</i>, from the Authority of the <i>Japanese</i> Map of <i>Kempfer</i>,
which must be of some Repute, as it is so agreeable to the <i>Russian</i>
Discoveries: If true in that Part, there is no Reason to suppose
but it is in like Manner true as to the other Part which is
introduced into this Map. This Map exhibits the Streight that
<i>de Fuca</i> went up, the Communication which there may be supposed
agreeable to the Lights which the Accounts afford us between
the Sea at the Back of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay with that Bay, or with
the <i>North Sea</i> by <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights, or through <i>Cumberland</i> Isles.
There is also added a second Map, to shew what Expectations
may be had of a Passage from <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, according to the Discoveries
made in the Year 1747. The third Map is an exact Copy
from that published in the <i>Monarquia Indiana de Torquemada</i>, in
which the Sea Coast of <i>America</i> is exhibited in a different Manner
from what it usually was in the Maps of that Time, compleated
by the Cosmographers of <i>Philip</i> the Third. The Work itself is
in few Hands, and the Map, as far as appears, hath been only
published in that Book, is now again published, as it illustrates
this Work, and may be otherwise agreeable to the Curious;
having a Desire not to omit any Thing which would render the
Work compleat, or that would be acceptable to the Publick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span></p>

<p>I have used uncommon Pains to be informed as to what could
be any way serviceable to render this Work more compleat; and
must make this publick Acknowledgement, as to the Gentlemen
of the <i>British Museum</i>, who, with great Politeness and Affability,
gave me all the Assistances in their Power to find if the Copy
from which the Translation was made was in their Possession,
which after an accurate Search for some Weeks it did not appear
to be, and also their Assistance as to any other Matters which I
Supposed would be of Service. I cannot pass by Mr. <i>Jefferys</i>'s
Care and Exactness in executing the Maps, whose Care and Fidelity
to the Publick not to impose any Thing that is spurious,
but what he hath an apparent and real Authority for, is perhaps
not sufficiently known.</p>

<p>The Voyage, an Extract from which is added by Way of Appendix,
was made from <i>Philadelphia</i>, in a Schooner of about sixty
Tons, and fifteen Persons aboard, fitted out on a Subscription of
the Merchants of <i>Maryland</i>, <i>Pennsylvania</i>, <i>New York</i>, and <i>Boston</i>,
on a generous Plan, agreeable to Proposals made them, with no
View of any Monopoly which they opposed, not to interfere with
the <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay Trade, or to carry on a clandestine Trade with
the Natives of <i>Greenland</i>, but to discover a North-west Passage,
and explore the <i>Labrador</i> Coast, at that Time supposed to be
locked up under a pretended Right, and not frequented by the
Subjects of <i>England</i>, but a successful Trade carried on by the
<i>French</i>; to open a Trade there, to improve the Fishery and the
Whaling on these Coasts, cultivate a Friendship with the Natives,
and make them serviceable in a political Way: Which Design
of theirs of a publick Nature, open and generous, was in a great
Measure defeated by private Persons interfering, whose Views
were more contracted.</p>

<p>They did not succeed the first Year as to their Attempt in discovering
a North-west Passage, as it was a great Year for Ice;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
that it would be late in the Year before the Western Part of
<i>Hudson</i>'s Bay could be attained to, and then impossible to explore the
<i>Labrador</i> that Year, therefore the first Part of the Design was
dropped, and the <i>Labrador</i> was explored. The next Year a second
Attempt was made as to a Passage; but three of the People
who went beyond the Place appointed by their Orders, and inadvertently
to look for a Mine, Samples of which had been carried
home the Year before, and this at the Instigation of a private
Person before they set out from home, without the Privity of
the Commander, were killed by the <i>Eskemaux</i>, and the Boat taken
from them. After which Accident, with some disagreeable Circumstances
consequent thereon amongst the Schooner's Company,
and after an Experiment made of their Disinclination to proceed
on any further Discovery, it was thought most prudent to return.
This short Account is given by the Person who commanded in
this Affair, to prevent any Misrepresentation hereafter of what
was done on these Voyages.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>A Letter from Admiral</i> Bartholomew de Fonte, <i>then
Admiral of</i> New Spain <i>and</i> Peru, <i>and now Prince of</i>
Chili; <i>giving an Account of the most material Transactions
in a Journal of his from the Calo of</i> Lima <i>in</i>
Peru, <i>on his Discoveries, to find out if there was any
North West Passage from the</i> Atlantick <i>Ocean into
the South and Tartarian Sea.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Viceroys of <i>New Spain</i> and <i>Peru</i>, having advice from
the Court of <i>Spain</i>, that the several Attempts of the <i>English</i>,
both in the Reigns of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, King <i>James</i>, and of Capt.
<i>Hudson</i> and Capt. <i>James</i>, in the 2d, 3d and 4th Years of King
<i>Charles</i>, was in the 14th Year of the said King <i>Charles</i>, A. D. 1639,
undertaken from some Industrious Navigators from <i>Boston</i> in <i>New
England</i>, upon which I Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> received Orders from
<i>Spain</i> and the Viceroys to Equip four Ships of Force, and being
ready we put to Sea the 3d of <i>April</i> 1640, from the Calo of <i>Lima</i>,
I Admiral <i>Bartholomew de Fonte</i> in the Ship <i>St Spiritus</i>, the Vice-Admiral
<i>Don Diego Pennelossa</i>, in the Ship <i>St Lucia</i>, <i>Pedro de Bonardæ</i>,
in the Ship <i>Rosaria</i>, <i>Philip de Ronquillo</i> in the <i>King Philip</i>.
The 7th of <i>April</i> at 5 in the Afternoon, we had the length of <i>St
Helen</i>, two hundred Leagues on the <i>North</i> side of the Bay of <i>Guajaquil</i>,
in 2 Degrees of <i>South</i> Lat. and anchored in the Port <i>St
Helena</i>, within the Cape, where each Ship's Company took in a
quantity of <i>Betumen</i>, called vulgarly <i>Tar</i>, of a dark colour with a
cast of Green, an excellent Remedy against the Scurvy and Dropsie,
and is used as Tar for Shipping, but we took it in for Medicine;
it Boils out of the Earth, and is there plenty. The <i>10th</i> we pass'd
the Equinoctial by Cape <i>del Passao</i>, the <i>11th</i> Cape <i>St Francisco</i>, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
one Degree and seven Minutes of Latitude North from the Equator,
and anchor'd in the Mouth of the<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>River <i>St Jago</i>, where with a
Sea-Net we catch'd abundance of good Fish; and several of each
Ship's Company went ashoar, and kill'd some Goats and Swine,
which are there wild and in plenty; and others bought of some
Natives, 20 dozen of <i>Turkey</i> Cocks and Hens, Ducks, and much
excellent Fruit, at a Village two <i>Spanish</i> Leagues, six Mile and a
half, up the River <i>St Jago</i>, on the Larboard side or the Left hand.
The River is Navigable for small Vessels from the Sea, about 14
<i>Spanish</i> Leagues <i>South East</i>, about half way to the fair City of
<i>Quita</i>, in 22 Minutes of <i>South</i> Latitude, a City that is very Rich.
The <i>16th</i> of <i>April</i> we sailed from the River <i>St Jago</i> to the Port
and Town <i>Raleo</i>, 320 Leagues W. N. W. a little Westerly, in about
11 Degrees 14 Min. of N. Latitude, leaving Mount <i>St Miguel</i> on
the Larboard side, and Point <i>Cazamina</i> on the Starboard side. The
Port of <i>Raleo</i> is a safe Port, is covered from the Sea by the Islands
<i>Ampallo</i> and <i>Mangreza</i>, both well inhabited with Native <i>Indians</i>,
and 3 other small Islands.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a><i>Raleo</i> is but 4 Miles over Land from
the head of the Lake <i>Nigaragua</i>, that falls into the North Sea in
12 Degrees of North Latitude, near the Corn or Pearl Islands.
Here at the Town of <i>Raleo</i>, where is abundance of excellent close
grain'd Timber, a reddish Cedar, and all Materials for building
Shipping; we bought 4 long well sail'd Shallops, built express for
sailing and riding at Anchor and rowing, about 12 Tuns each, of
32 foot Keel. The <i>26th</i>, we sailed from <i>Raleo</i> for the Port of
<i>Saragua</i>, or rather of <i>Salagua</i>, within the Islands and Shoals of
<i>Chamily</i>, and the Port is often call'd by the <i>Spaniards</i> after that
Name; in 17 Degrees 31 Minutes of North Latitude, 480 Leagues
North West and by West, a little Westerly from <i>Raleo</i>. From the
Town of <i>Saragua</i>, a little East of <i>Chamily</i> at <i>Saragua</i>, and from
<i>Compostilo</i> in the Neighbourhood of this Port, we took in a Master
and six Mariners accustomed to Trade with the Natives on the East
side of <i>California</i> for Pearl; the Natives catch'd on a Bank in 19
Degrees of Latitude North from the <i>Baxos St Juan</i>, in 24 Degrees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
of North Latitude 20 Leagues N. N. E. from Cape St <i>Lucas</i>, the
South East point of <i>California</i>. The Master Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> had
hir'd, with his Vessel and Mariners, who had informed the Admiral,
that 200 Leagues North from Cape St <i>Lucas</i>, a Flood from
the North, met the South Flood, and that he was sure it must be
an Island, and <i>Don Diego Pennelossa</i> (Sisters Son of<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a><i>Don Lewis de
Haro</i>) a young Nobleman of great Knowledge and Address in Cosmography
and Navigation, and undertook to discover whether <i>California</i>
was an Island or not; for before it was not known whether
it was an Island or a <i>Peninsula</i>; with his Ship and the 4 Shallops
they brought at <i>Raleo</i>, and the Master and Mariners they hir'd at
<i>Salagua</i>, but Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> with the other 3 Ships sailed from
them within the Islands <i>Chamily</i> the <i>10th</i> of <i>May</i> 1640. and having
the length of Cape <i>Abel</i>, on the W. S. W. side of <i>California</i> in 26
Degrees of N. Latitude, 160 Leagues N. W. and W. from the Isles
<i>Chamily</i>; the Wind sprung up at S. S. E. a steady Gale, that from
the <i>26th</i> of <i>May</i> to the <i>14th</i> of <i>June</i>, he had sail'd to the River
<i>los Reyes</i> in 53 Degrees of N. Latitude, not having occasion to lower
a Topsail, in sailing 866 Leagues N. N. W. 410 Leagues from Port
<i>Abel</i> to Cape Blanco, 456 Leagues to <i>Rio los Reyes</i>, all the time most
pleasant Weather, and sailed about 260 Leagues in crooked Channels,
amongst Islands named the<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a><i>Archipelagus de St Lazarus</i>;
where his Ships Boats sail'd a mile a head, sounding to see what
Water, Rocks and Sands there was. The 22d of <i>June</i>, Admiral
<i>Fonte</i> dispatched one of his Captains to <i>Pedro de Barnarda</i>, to sail
up a fair River, a gentle Stream and deep Water, went first N. and
N. E. N. and N. W. into a large Lake full of Islands, and one very
large <i>Peninsula</i> full of Inhabitants, a Friendly honest People in this
Lake; he named Lake <i>Valasco</i>, where Captain <i>Barnarda</i> left his
Ship; nor all up the River was less than 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 Fathom
Water, both the Rivers and Lakes abounding with Salmon Trouts,
and very large white Pearch, some of two foot long; and with 3
large <i>Indian</i> Boats, by them called <i>Periagos</i>, made of two large
Trees 50 and 60 foot long. Capt. <i>Barnarda</i> first sailed from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Ships in the Lake <i>Valasco</i>, one hundred and forty Leagues West,
and then 436 E. N. E. to 77 Degrees of Latitude. Admiral <i>de
Fonte</i>, after he had dispatch'd Captain <i>Barnarda</i> on the Discovery
of the North and East part of the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea, the Admiral sail'd
up a very Navigable River, which he named <i>Rio los Reyes</i>, that run
nearest North East, but on several Points of the Compass 60
Leagues at low Water, in a fair Navigable Channel, not less than
4 or 5 Fathom Water. It flow'd in both Rivers near the same Water,
in the River <i>los Reyes</i>, 24 foot Full and Change of the Moon;
a S. S. E. Moon made high Water. It flow'd in the River <i>de Haro</i>
22 foot and a half Full and Change. They had two<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>Jesuits with
them that had been on their Mission to the 66 Degrees of North
Latitude, and had made curious Observations. The Admiral <i>de
Fonte</i> received a Letter from Captain <i>Barnarda</i>, dated the 27th of
<i>June</i>, 1640. that he had left his Ship in the Lake <i>Valasco</i>, betwixt
the Island <i>Barnarda</i> and the Peninsula <i>Conibasset</i>, a very safe Port;
it went down a River from the Lake, 3 falls, 80 Leagues, and
fell into the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea in 61 Degrees, with the Pater Jesuits
and 36 Natives in three of their Boats, and 20 of his <i>Spanish</i> Seamen;
that the Land trended away North East; that they should
want no Provisions, the Country abounding with Venison of 3 sorts,
and the Sea and Rivers with excellent Fish (Bread, Salt, Oyl and
Brandy they carry'd with them) that he should do what was possible.
The Admiral, when he received the Letter from Captain
<i>Barnarda</i>, was arrived at an <i>Indian</i> Town called <i>Conosset</i>, on the
South-side the Lake <i>Belle</i>, where the two Pater Jesuits on their Mission
had been two Years; a pleasant Place. The Admiral with his
two Ships, enter'd the Lake the 22d of <i>June</i>, an Hour before high
Water, and there was no Fall or Catract, and 4 or 5 Fathom Water,
and 6 and 7 generally in the Lake <i>Belle</i>, there is a little fall
of Water till half Flood, and an Hour and quarter before high
Water the Flood begins to set gently into the Lake <i>Belle</i>; the
River is fresh at 20 Leagues distance from the Mouth, or Entrance
of the River <i>los Reyes</i>. The River and Lake abounds with Salmon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Salmon-Trouts, Pikes, Perch and Mullets, and two other sorts
of Fish peculiar to that River, admirable good, and Lake <i>Belle</i>;
also abounds with all those sorts of Fish large and delicate: And
Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> says, the Mullets catch'd in <i>Rios Reyes</i> and Lake
<i>Belle</i>, are much delicater than are to be found, he believes, in
any part of the World.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 1708.</div>

<p class="hang"><i>The Remainder of Admiral</i> Bartholomew de Fonte'<i>s
Letter; giving an Account of the most material
Transactions in a Journal of his from the Calo of</i>
Lima <i>in</i> Peru, <i>on his Discoveries to find out if there
was any North West Passage from the</i> Atlantick <i>Ocean
into the South and Tartarian Sea; which for want of
Room we could not possibly avoid postponing.</i></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>See the Memoirs for April 1708, and you'll find the
beginning of this Curious Discovery.</i></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> concluded with giving an Account of a Letter from Capt.
<i>Barnarda</i>, dated the 27th of <i>June</i>, 1640. on his Discovery
in the Lake <i>Valasco</i>. The first of <i>July</i> 1640, Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>
sailed from the rest of his Ships in the Lake <i>Belle</i>, in a good
Port cover'd by a fine Island, before the Town <i>Conosset</i> from
thence to a River I named <i>Parmentiers</i>, in honour of my Industrious
Judicious Comrade, Mr <i>Parmentiers</i>, who had most exactly
mark'd every thing in and about that River; we pass'd 8 Falls,
in all 32 foot, perpendicular from its Sourse out of <i>Belle</i>; it falls
into the large Lake I named Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, at which place we arrived
the 6th of <i>July</i>. This Lake is 160 Leagues long and 60
broad, the length is E. N. E. and W. S. W. to 20 or 30, in some
places 60 Fathom deep; the Lake abounds with excellent Cod and
Ling, very large and well fed, there are several very large Islands
and 10 small ones; they are covered with shrubby Woods, the
Moss grows 6 or 7 foot long, with which the Moose, a very large
sort of Deer, are fat with in the Winter, and other lesser Deer,
as Fallow, <i>&amp;c.</i> There are abundance of wild Cherries, Strawberries,
Hurtleberries, and wild Currants, and also of wild Fowl
Heath Cocks and Hens, likewise Partridges and Turkeys, and Sea
Fowl in great plenty on the South side: The Lake is a very large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
fruitful Island, had a great many Inhabitants, and very excellent
Timber, as Oaks, Ashes, Elm and Fur-Trees, very large and tall.</p>

<p>The 14th of <i>July</i> we sailed out of the E. N. E. end of the Lake
<i>de Fonte</i>, and pass'd a Lake I named <i>Estricho de Ronquillo</i>, 34
Leagues long, 2 or 3 Leagues broad, 20, 26, and 28 Fathom of
Water; we pass'd this strait in 10 hours, having a stout Gale of
Wind and whole Ebb. As we sailed more Easterly, the Country
grew very sensibly worse, as it is in the North and South parts of
<i>America</i>, from 36 to the extream Parts North or South, the West
differs not only in Fertility but in Temperature of Air, at least 10
Degrees, and it is warmer on the West side than on the East, as
the best <i>Spanish</i> Discoverers found it, whose business it was in the
time of the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the V. to <i>Philip</i> the III. as is noted
by <i>Aloares</i> and a <i>Costa</i> and <i>Mariana</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The 17th we came to an <i>Indian</i> Town, and the <i>Indians</i> told our
Interpreter Mr <i>Parmentiers</i>, that a little way from us lay a great
Ship where there had never been one before; we sailed to them,
and found only one Man advanced in years, and a Youth; the Man
was the greatest Man in the Mechanical Parts of the Mathematicks
I had ever met with; my second Mate was an <i>English</i> Man, an
excellent Seaman, as was my Gunner, who had been taken Prisoners
at <i>Campechy</i>, as well as the Master's Son; they told me the
Ship was of <i>New England</i>, from a Town called <i>Boston</i>. The Owner
and the whole Ships Company came on board the 30th, and the
Navigator of the Ship, Capt. <i>Shapley</i>, told me, his Owner was a
fine Gentleman, and Major General of the largest Colony in <i>New
England</i>, called the <i>Maltechusets</i>; so I received him like a Gentleman,
and told him, my Commission was to make Prize of any
People seeking a North West or West Passage into the South Sea
but I would look upon them as Merchants trading with the Natives
for Bevers, Otters, and other Furs and Skins, and so for a small
Present of Provisions I had no need on, I gave him my Diamond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
Ring, which cost me 1200 Pieces of Eight, (which the modest
Gentleman received with difficulty) and having given the brave
Navigator, Capt. <i>Shapley</i> for his fine Charts and Journals, 1000
Pieces of Eight, and the Owner of the Ship, <i>Seimor Gibbons</i> a
quarter Cask of good <i>Peruan</i> Wine, and the 10 Seamen each 20
Pieces of Eight, the 6th of <i>August</i>, with as much Wind as we could
fly before, and a Currant, we arrived at the first Fall of the River
<i>Parmentiers</i>, the 11th of <i>August</i>, 86 Leagues, and was on the
South side of the Lake <i>Belle</i> on board our Ships the 16th of <i>August</i>,
before the fine Town <i>Conosset</i>, where we found all things well;
and the honest Natives of <i>Conosset</i> had in our absence treated our
People with great humanity, and Capt. <i>de Ronquillo</i> answer'd their
Civility and Justice.</p>

<p>The 20th of <i>August</i> an <i>Indian</i> brought me a Letter to <i>Conosset</i> on
the Lake <i>Belle</i>, from Capt. <i>Barnarda</i>, dated the 11th of <i>August</i>, where
he sent me word he was returned from his Cold Expedition, and
did assure me there was no Communication out of the <i>Spanish</i> or
<i>Atlantick</i> Sea, by <i>Davis</i> Strait; for the Natives had conducted one
of his Seamen to the head of <i>Davis</i> Strait, which terminated in a
fresh Lake of about 30 Mile in circumference, in the 80th Degree
of North Latitude; and that there was prodigious Mountains North
of it, besides the North West from that Lake, the Ice was so fix'd,
that from the Shore to 100 Fathom Water, for ought he knew
from the Creation; for Mankind knew little of the wonderful
Works of God, especially near the North and South Poles; he writ
further, that he had sailed from <i>Basset</i> Island North East, and East
North East, and North East and by East, to the 79th Degree of
Latitude, and then the Land trended North, and the Ice rested on
the Land. I received afterwards a second Letter from Capt. <i>Barnarda</i>,
dated from <i>Minhanset</i>, informing me, that he made the Port
of <i>Arena</i>, 20 Leagues up the River <i>los Reyes</i> on the 29th of <i>August</i>,
where he waited my Commands. I having store of good Salt
Provisions, of Venison and Fish, that Capt. <i>de Ronquillo</i> had salted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
(by my order) in my absence, and 100 Hogsheads of <i>Indian</i> Wheat
or Mais, sailed the 2d of <i>September</i> 1640. accompanied with many
of the honest Natives of <i>Conosset</i>, and the 5th of <i>September</i> in the
Morning about 8, was at an Anchor betwixt <i>Arena</i> and <i>Mynhanset</i>,
in the River <i>los Reyes</i>, sailing down that River to the North East
part of the South Sea; after that returned home, having found
that there was no Passage into the South Sea by that they call the
North West Passage. The Chart will make this much more demonstrable.</p>

<p><i>Tho the Style of the foregoing Piece is not altogether so Polite, (being
writ like a Man, whose livelihood depended on another way) but with
abundance of Experience and a Traveller, yet there are so many Curious,
and hitherto unknown Discoveries, that it was thought worthy a place
in these</i> Memoirs; <i>and 'tis humbly presum'd it will not be unacceptable
to those who have either been in those Parts, or will give themselves
the trouble of reviewing the Chart.</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h2>OBSERVATIONS<br />

<small>ON</small></h2>

<p class="hang"><i>The Title affixed, and on other Circumstances relating to
the Letter of Admiral</i> de Fonte, <i>shewing the Authenticity
of that Letter, and of the Account therein contained.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Observations</span> have been made by several Geographers of
different Nations on the Letter of Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>, to shew that
such Letter is not deserving of Credit, is to be thought of as a mere
Fiction or Romance, and is a Forgery composed by some Person to serve
a particular Purpose. But it will appear, as we proceed in a more particular
Consideration of the Title and Circumstances relative to the Letter
of Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> than hath been hitherto used, and from the following
Remarks on the Subject of such Letter<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>, That those Observations
made by the Geographers have many of them no just Foundation,
the rest afford not a sufficient Evidence to invalidate the Authenticity of
that Letter, and of the Account it contains.</p>

<p>It is only from a Copy of the Letter of <i>de Fonte</i> that the Translation
hath been made, which is now published, as is plain from a Title
being affixed, <i>A Letter from Admiral</i> Bartholomew de Fonte, <i>then Admiral
of</i> New Spain <i>and</i> Peru, <i>and now Prince of</i> Chili. As <i>Prince</i> is
never used in this Sense with us, it is apparently a literal Translation
of the <i>Spanish</i> Word <i>Principe</i>, consequently this Title was wrote in
the <i>Spanish</i> Language, and we cannot otherwise conclude but in the
same Language with the Letter. From this and other Defects of the
like Sort, which will be noticed as we proceed in our Observations, the
Translator must be acquitted from all Suspicion of being any way concerned
in this pretended Forgery.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
By the Copiest affixing this Title, it is evident he was well assured
that there had been such an Expedition.</p>

<p>The Anecdotes, as to the Vice-admiral <i>Pennelossa</i>, in the Body of the
Letter, what is therein mentioned as to the Jesuits, evidence that a
minute and particular Inquiry was made by the Copiest; that he had
thoroughly informed himself of every Particular of this Affair; that he
was assured that the Account by him copied contained the most material
Transactions in a Journal of <i>de Fonte</i>'s, and that <i>de Fonte</i> was then,
probably from his advanced Age, in the Service of the Government in
another Station.</p>

<p>This Expedition not being solely to intercept the Navigators from
<i>Boston</i>, but also to discover whether there was a Passage in those Parts
thro' which the <i>English</i> expected to make a Passage, <i>viz.</i> by the back Part
of <i>Virginia</i>, by <i>Hudson</i>'s or by <i>Baffin</i>'s Bay; it was an Undertaking
which required that the Person who had the conducting of it should not
only be a Man of good Understanding, but a judicious and experienced
Seaman. The Time required to attain such Qualifications implies, that
<i>de Fonte</i> must have been of a mature Age when he went on this Command;
and <i>de Fonte</i> being alive at the Time that the Copy was taken,
it must have been taken within twenty Years, or in a less Time after such
Expedition, as the Copiest speaks of <i>Pennelossa</i> as a young Nobleman.
The Copiest therefore could not be imposed on, as his Inquiries were
made in such a Time, either with respect to the Persons concerned, or
with respect to the Letter not being a genuine Account of the Voyage.</p>

<p>A Person might be so circumstanced as to attain the Favour of copying
such Letter, induced by some private Motive, without an Intention of
making it publick, as Publications were not at that Time so frequent
as of late Days; neither is it less probable that a Copy so taken may,
in Process of Time, come into other Hands and then be published.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Gage</i> observes, in his Dedication to Lord <i>Fairfax</i>, 'The Reason
of his publishing a New Survey of the <i>West Indies</i> to be, because that
nothing had been written of these Parts for these hundred Years last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
past, which is almost ever since from the first Conquest thereof by the
<i>Spaniards</i>, who are contented to lose the Honour of that Wealth and
Felicity, which they have since purchased by their great Endeavours,
so that they may enjoy the Safety of retaining what they have formerly
gotten in Peace and Security.' And though <i>de Fonte</i> declares
that there was no North-west Passage, yet that there should be no Publication
of the Account of the Voyage is consistent with this established
Maxim.</p>

<p>The North-west Passage he mentions is not to be understood, in
an unlimited Sense, for a Passage between the <i>Atlantick</i> and Western
Ocean to the Northward, but the Meaning is confined to that Passage
expected by <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay: For <i>de Fonte</i> says, that he was to make a
Prize of <i>any seeking a North-west or West Passage</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>; by the latter he
meant where <i>Pennelossa</i> was sent to search; and <i>Bernarda</i> says, there was
no Communication out of the <i>Spanish</i> or <i>Atlantick</i> Sea, by <i>Davis</i> Streight;
and there was an Extent of Coast which <i>de Fonte</i> only ran along, and
had, but at Times, a distant View of; and as to the Jesuits, by whatever
Means they got into those Parts, it is evident they had not seen
all the intermediate Country. Therefore tho' the Court of <i>Spain</i> was
satisfied that the Passage was not where <i>de Fonte</i> had searched; yet there
might be a Passage where he had not searched, and publishing this Account
of the Voyage would be an Assistance to the Adventurers, as
it would confine them in their Searches to those other Parts which
were cursorily passed by <i>de Fonte</i>, and where perhaps they might succeed:
Or this Account particularly describing the Northern and
Western Part of <i>America</i>, not hitherto known, would be of great Service
to Rovers, who had already found their Way into those Seas, by
directing them to the Coast and Harbours, and giving them an Account
of a Country where they could retire to with tolerable Security from any
Interruption from the <i>Spaniards</i>, a good Climate, hospitable People, and
a Plenty of Provisions to be had; Circumstances which might enable
them to continue their cruizing in those Seas much longer than without
such Lights as they would receive from this Account they would be enabled
to do.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
It is well known that the <i>Spaniards</i> claimed all to the Northward as their
Dominion, which they intended in due Time to acquire the Possession
of, and the Publication might give an Insight to the <i>English</i>; Settlers in
<i>America</i> to be beforehand with them in attaining a Settlement in those
Parts.</p>

<p>Their Attempt to intercept the <i>English</i> Subjects, when made Publick
to the World, would have given Umbrage to the Court and People of
<i>England</i>, which the <i>Spaniards</i> would not unnecessarily, and especially at
a Time when they had their Hands full of a War with the <i>French</i>, who
had also incited the <i>Catalonians</i> to rebel, and had joined them with their
Troops. The <i>Spaniards</i> were, at the same Time, endeavouring to recover
the Dominions of <i>Portugal</i>. And <i>de Fonte</i> had respect to the critical
Situation their Affairs were in, even before he set out on his Voyage,
hence his political Behaviour when he met with the Navigators from
<i>Boston</i>, committed no Act of Hostility, yet made Use of the most effective
Means to prevent their proceeding further.</p>

<p>As no Publication was permitted of this Expedition, this therefore
could come but to the Knowledge only of a very few Persons in <i>Old
Spain</i>. Such a singular Transaction being soon, from their Attention
to other Matters, and their Ministry soon after entirely changed, no
more talked of, unless it should have been revived by something of the
like Nature again happening on the Part of the <i>English</i>. As no Attempt
was made by the <i>English</i> for almost a Century, this Transaction,
in that Time, fell into Oblivion. At the Time such Attempt was renewed,
then the <i>Spaniards</i> were better acquainted with the Purpose of
our settling in <i>America</i>, they had altered their Designs of extending
their own Possessions, there was also another Power who might pretend
that such Passage, if made, was Part in their Dominion, so obstruct
our free proceeding and interrupt our settling; the <i>Spaniards</i>
therefore having no immediate Occasion for any Researches back to
the Records to acquaint themselves as to the Practicability or Impracticability
of our Attempts, or to take Directions for their own Proceedings,
the Remembrance of this Expedition continued dormant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>In <i>New Spain</i>, the fitting four Ships to go on Discovery, as such Undertakings
had been very frequent, it would not engage any extraordinary
Attention of the Publick there; it often happened that what
was done on such Voyages was kept a Secret. The more curious and
inquisitive Persons would attain but an imperfect Account, by Inquiry
from the People on board the Ships, as the Ships were divided, and
they would receive no satisfactory Information of what was most material,
and the principal Object of their Inquiry by those who went in the
Boats, as Seamen delighting in Stories often tell what they neither heard
or saw. The Consequences of the Voyage not known, because not understood,
a weak Tradition of this Expedition would remain to Posterity;
and the only Knowledge or Certainty to be acquired, as to this
Expedition, would be from Journals accidentally preserved, of some
Persons who had gone the Voyage.</p>

<p>Mons. <i>de Lisle</i> gives us an Extract of a Letter from Mons. <i>Antonio de
Ulloa</i>, wrote from <i>Aranguer</i> the 19th of <i>June</i> in the Year 1753<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, to Mons.
<i>Bouguer e le Mounier</i>, to answer the Queries they had made on the Subject
of the Letter of Admiral <i>de Fuente</i>. That curious and able <i>Spanish</i>
Officer sent them in Answer, That in the Year 1742 he commanded a
Ship of War the <i>Rose</i>, in the South Sea; he had on board him a Lieutenant
of the Vessel named <i>Don Manuel Morel</i>, an antient Seaman, who
shewed him a Manuscript; <i>Mons. Ulloa</i> forgot the Author's Name, but
believes it to be <i>Barthelemi de Fuentes</i>, the Author in that Manuscript
reported, that in Consequence of an Order which he had received from
the then Viceroy of <i>Peru</i>, that he had been to the Northward of <i>California</i>,
to discover whether there was a Passage by which there was a
Communication between the North and South Sea; but having reached
a certain Northern Latitude, which <i>Mons. Ulloa</i> did not recollect, and
having found nothing that indicated such Passage, he returned to the
Port of <i>Callao</i>, &amp;c. <i>Mons. Ulloa</i> adds, he had a Copy of such Relation,
but he lost it when he was taken by the <i>English</i> on his return from
<i>America</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
It is evident, from this Account being seen in 1742, it is not the
same from which the Translation is made which we now have, that
being published in 1708. And as <i>Mons. de Lisle</i> asserts, that the Letter
is conformable with what <i>Mons. Ulloa</i> said at <i>Paris</i> three Years before,
with this Difference only, that he said positively at that Time, that the
Relation which he had seen at <i>Peru</i>, and of which he had taken a Copy,
was of Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>, this Manuscript, which contained the Account
of the Voyage, may rather be supposed to be a Relation, or Journal
kept by some Person, who was aboard Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>'s Ship, a Friend
or Ancestor of <i>Morel</i>, than a Copy the same with this Letter, as it only
mentioned the Purport of the Voyage, seems not to have the particular
Circumstances as to intercepting the <i>Boston</i> Men. This Account
is an Evidence so far in Favour of this Letter, as it proves that
this Letter is not the only Account that there is of this Voyage, and
that another Account was seen and copied at <i>Peru</i> many Years after
this Letter was published in <i>England</i>. But if it be supposed that it is
one and the same Account, and that from the <i>English</i>, it would not
have been accepted of and kept by <i>Morel</i>, and shewed as a Curiosity,
unless he was satisfied that it was a true genuine Account of such
Voyage, and as to which he would naturally inquire, being on the
Spot, where he might probably be informed, and unless he was at a Certainty
that what that Account contained was true, would he have produced
the Manuscript, or permitted his Captain to take a Copy of it as
genuine; yet we may with greater Probability suppose, that this Manuscript
which <i>Morel</i> had was no Translation from the <i>English</i>, but in
itself an Original. Mons. <i>Ulloa</i> speaking of <i>Morel</i> as an antient Seaman,
cannot mean that he was in the Expedition of <i>de Fonte</i>, only implies
his being acquainted with some one who was, with whom, from
his Course of Years, he might have sailed, and attained this Journal.</p>

<p>What is said in the Letter of Mons. <i>Ulloa</i>, that he forgot the Name of
the Author of the Manuscript, but believes it was <i>Bartelemi de Fuentes</i>,
that the Author of that Manuscript gave an Account of. It must be
considered, that when Mons. <i>Ulloa</i> wrote he was in <i>Old Spain</i>, many
Years after he had seen the Account, and three Years after he was at
<i>Paris</i>; and though he genteelly answers the Inquiries sent him, agreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
to his Conversation at <i>Paris</i>, yet does not express himself so positively
as when at <i>Paris</i>, as in the Letter he only believes it to be <i>Bartelemi
de Fonte</i>. <i>Mons. Ulloa</i> would sooner not have answered the Letter
than deny what he had formerly said; and if Mons. <i>de Lisle</i> had advanced
that for which he had no proper Authority, both as a Gentleman and
an Officer he would not have submitted to such a Falshood: But from
Mons. <i>Ulloa</i> being tender in the Account, being of a Matter which might
not make any great Impression on him at the Time he received it, ten
Years since, out of his Hands, and three Years after he was at <i>Paris</i>, this
Account is more worthy of Credit, and he might be more cautious,
now he was to give it under his Hand, to soften the Reproach of his
Countrymen for his not acting like a true <i>Spaniard</i>, in being so communicative
in this Matter. The Account which Mons. <i>de Lisle</i> hath given,
was with a Permission of Mons. <i>Ulloa</i> to make Use of his Name, as the
Letter Mons. <i>Ulloa</i> sent testifies. Where Mons. <i>de Lisle</i> hath not the Liberty
to mention the Name of his Author, he only says, that there was
a Person equally curious, and as well instructed in the Affair as Mons.
<i>de Ulloa</i>, who assured him positively that there was such a Relation.</p>

<p>Though Mons. <i>de Lisle</i> had a particular System to support, yet, at
the same Time, he had a great publick Character to preserve. Mons.
<i>Bougier</i>, <i>Mounier</i>, and <i>Ulloa</i>, were living at the Time he gave this Account
to the Publick; they would be asked as to what they knew of the
Affair; and a more particular Inquiry would be made of Mons. <i>de Lisle</i>,
as to the Information he received from the nameless Person; and as
there were several of his Countrymen who did not adopt his System, a
Trip in this Affair, as to the Evidence he brings in Support of the Authority
of this Account of <i>de Fonte</i>, would have given them an Advantage
which they would not have neglected, and have done Justice to the
Publick, by letting them know there was little of Truth in this Account;
but as no Reflections have appeared, we have no Reason to
question the Veracity of Mons. <i>de Lisle</i> in this Relation, on any Surmises
of Strangers, on no better Authority than meer Opinion, without a
single Reason produced in Support of what they insinuate.</p>

<p>This Letter, when published in 1708, was considered only as an Account
that was curious; was looked on as of no Importance, and did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
not engage the Attention of the Publick until the Discovery of the North-west
Passage became the Topick of common Conversation, and would
have lain, without having any further Notice taken of it, had not the
Attempts to discover a North-west Passage been revived. It is from
their being produced in a proper Season, that Accounts of this Sort become
permanent, assisting in some favourite Design, being thus useful
they are preserved from Obscurity and Oblivion. We have an Account,
the Author Captain <i>Don Francisco de Seixas</i>, a Captain in the <i>Spanish</i> Navy,
and is frequently quoted by the <i>Spanish</i> Writers, though he is little known
amongst us.&mdash;He says, P. 71. '<i>Thomas Peche</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>, having been
at Sea twenty-eight Years, and made eight Voyages to the <i>East-Indies</i>
and <i>China</i> during sixteen Years of that Time, spent the other twelve in
Trading and Piracies in the <i>West-Indies</i>, from whence he returned to
<i>England</i> in 1669; and, after continuing there four Years, in 1673,
with other Companions, fitted out at the Port of <i>Bristol</i> one Ship of
five hundred Tons, with forty-four Guns, and two light Frigates of
one hundred and fifty Tons, and in each eighteen Guns, giving out
that he was bound on a trading Voyage to the <i>Canaries</i>; whence they
bore away with the three Vessels, and went through the Streight <i>Le
Maire</i>, with two hundred and seventy Men, which he carried directly
to trade at the <i>Moluccas</i> and <i>Philippinas</i>.</p>

<p>'And after continuing in those Parts twenty-six Months and some
Days, it appearing to the said <i>Thomas Peche</i> that from the <i>Philippinas</i>
he could return to <i>England</i> in a shorter Time by the Streight of <i>Anian</i>
than by the East or Streight <i>Magellan</i>, he determined to pass this
Rout with his large Ship, and one small one, the other having lost
Company by bad Weather, or worse Design in those who commanded
it.</p>

<p>'And having, as he says, sailed one hundred and twenty Leagues
within the Streights of <i>Anian</i>, relates, that as the Month of <i>October</i>
was far advanced, in which the northerly Winds reign much, and drove
the Waters from the North to the South, that the Currents of the said
Streight of <i>Anian</i> were such, and so strong, that had they continued
longer they must, without Doubt, have been lost; wherefore, finding
it necessary to return back, sailing along the Coast of <i>California</i> (after
having sailed out of the Channel of <i>Anian</i>) and those of <i>New Spain</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
and <i>Peru</i>, he went through the Streight of <i>Magellan</i> into the North
Sea in sixteen Hundred and seventy-seven, with the Vessels and much
Riches, great Part whereof was of a <i>Spanish</i> Vessel which they took on
the Coast of <i>Lugan</i>.'</p>

<p>Wherefore passing over all the rest of what the Author says in his
Voyage, only mentioning what regarded the Currents, he relates, that
when he entered into the Streight of <i>Anian</i> he found, from Cape <i>Mendocino</i>
in <i>California</i>, for above twenty Leagues within the Channel, the
Currents set to the N. E. all which and much more the Curious will find
in the Voyage of the said <i>Thomas Peche</i>, which in sixteen Hundred and
seventy-nine was printed in <i>French</i> and <i>English</i>, in many Parts of <i>Holland</i>,
<i>France</i>, and <i>England</i>, in less than twenty Sheets Quarto: And
(he adds) further I can affirm, that I have seen the Author many Times
in the Year eighty-two, three and four in <i>Holland</i>, who had along
with him a <i>Spanish</i> Mestize born in the <i>Philippinas</i>, together with a
<i>Chinese</i>.</p>

<p>It can scarce be imagined the Whole is without Foundation, though
no such Voyage is at present to be come at, <i>Seyxas</i> publishing his Work
soon after the Publication by <i>Peche</i>, to which he particularly refers,
seems to obviate all Doubt of his Sincerity; and there are too many
Circumstances, which are collateral Evidence, mentioned, to imagine he
could be entirely deceived. He published his Work at <i>Madrid</i> in sixteen
Hundred and eighty-eight, dedicated to the King, as President in
his Royal Council of the <i>Indies</i>, and to the Marquis <i>de les Velez</i>; the
Work intituled, <i>Theatro Naval Hydrographico de Los Fluxos</i>, &amp;c. This
Account was received as a true and faithful Relation of a Voyage
performed, as it was published in various Languages; yet the Want of
this Account is a Particular, some Reason for Exception with us, that we
cannot receive it as a Certainty. And we are more suspicious as to the
Truth of any Accounts that we have received relating to the North-west
Part of <i>America</i>, than to any other Part of the Globe. Our Opinion
being in a great Measure influenced by the System we embrace, as,
Whether there is a North-west Passage, or not? And for this Reason
only, no Part of the Globe hath more engaged the Attention of the Geographers,
and with respect to which they had more different Opinions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Those whose Opinion it was that <i>Asia</i> and <i>America</i> were contiguous,
had, for many Years, their Opinion rejected, but now confirmed to be
true by the <i>Russian</i> Discoveries; and we may conclude they had a good
Authority for what they advanced, which was not transmitted down to
us, as they had such an Assurance of what they had advanced, as they
supposed there could never be the least Doubt of it. Those who advanced
that there was Passage between the <i>Atlantick</i> and Southern Ocean,
by a Streight in the Northern and Western Parts of <i>America</i>, and very
likely on a good Authority, have their Opinion opposed, all Accounts
of Voyagers treated as fabulous, and for the same Reason that the Opinion
of <i>Asia</i> and <i>America</i> being contiguous was rejected, as they could
produce nothing further for it than Tradition, and as to which the Tradition
now appears to have had its Foundation in Truth. Soon after
<i>America</i> was discovered, and the <i>Spaniards</i> had settled in <i>New Spain</i>,
the Report of there being a Streight prevailed, the Truth of this Report
hath not been disproved, and we have no just Reason to reject this
Tradition for positive Assertions which are produced without any Evidence,
but that our Attempts have not succeeded. Which is an Inference
deduced from a false Principle, for our not having had the expected Success
hitherto, doth not imply that we may not succeed hereafter, as we
proceed in our future Attempts; and all that hath been said, as to there
being no North-west Passage, is not adequate to the Tradition of there
being such a Passage. This Tradition is also supported by a few Accounts,
which we reject too absolutely. These Accounts are given by
various Persons, at different Times, without any Concern, Connection,
or even Acquaintance the one with the other; which Accounts shew
that the Opinion of their being such a Streight prevailed. These Accounts
were given by Foreigners; we could not receive them from any
other, as we did not frequent those Seas, and at present have no ready
Access to them. And as it was but occasionally that any Persons went
into those Parts, it is but by a few Persons only we could receive any
Information respecting thereto. Nor could we attain such Information
as we have in another Manner, than from what our own Countrymen
accidentally picked up, as a regular Publication of such Account was
not permitted, and as some thought themselves interested to keep the
most material Part a Secret, in hopes to turn it to Advantage, by being
employed, or receiving a Gratuity for their Discovery. And Allowances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
should be made, without declaring a Person immediately too credulous,
who reports what he hears only in Conversation from another; he may,
in such Conversation, omit many Circumstances which it would have
been necessary for him to be informed of, in order to give that Satisfaction
to others to whom he reports this Information, which he himself
received of the Truth of what was related to him at the Time of the Conversation.
And we have no Reason to censure those as too credulous
who have published these Accounts, until we get a more perfect Information
as to the North-west Parts of <i>America</i>, which at present remain
unknown. A Dispute arises as to the Situation of such a Streight;
and Accounts given by <i>Indians</i> are produced to prove that the Streight
cannot be in such a Part, where it is supposed to be so far to the
Southward as to have its Entrance from the South Sea, in Latitude
51; whereas, on a little Examination, it would appear that those <i>Indians</i>,
whose Accounts are produced, are almost equal Strangers as to
those Parts with the <i>Europeans</i>. They do not seek inhospitable Countries,
where there is little Produce, no Plenty of Fuel, great and frequent
Waters, Mountains and Swamps, having no Inducement from
Trade or on Account of War, as they would not go into those Parts to
seek their Enemy, whom, with less Hazard and a greater Certainty of
finding them, they could attack when returned from their Summer hunting
and fishing to their Retirements, where they live more comfortably
than in those Parts into which, by Necessity, they are obliged to go on
Account of the Chace, as they could not otherwise subsist themselves
and Families. And on due Examination it will appear all the Accounts
we have from the <i>Indians</i> are erroneously made use of, to evince that
there is no Streight in the Part that is contended for. Instead of too
severe a Censure on the Credulity of others, we should be cautious that
our Diffidence does not lead us into an unreasonable Incredulity, and
prevent our using such Testimony as is presented to us so candidly as
we ought to do, and prevent our getting a true Insight into an Affair
of such Importance; and the utmost that can be said of it is, that it is a
Point yet undetermined, whether there is a North-west Passage or not.</p>

<p>As to the original Letter of <i>de Fonte</i>, we interest ourselves in the important
Matter it contains, and therefore become more suspicious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
diffident, as to its Authenticity, than upon a due Use of our Reason it
will appear that we ought to be. As we have no Reason, as is apparent
from what hath been said, that the original Letter should ever come to
our Hands; and if it appear, as we proceed, that it is rather to be attributed
to inevitable Accidents, than there not having been such a Letter,
that we cannot attain any particular Information respecting thereto.
If it is considered that we have a Publication of such Letter, the Deficiencies
in which are not, as it will appear, any other than the Errors
of the Translator and Printer. That there are a great many concurring
Circumstances in Support of and conformable with what the Letter contains.
And the Account is composed of such Particulars as exceed the Industry
and Ingenuity of those who employ their Fancy in composing
ingenious Fictions. These various Branches of Evidence cannot be rejected,
if we make a fair Judgment in this Matter: There must be a
Prepossession from common Fame, a Prejudice from a prior Opinion,
or an Interest and Design to support a particular System, that prevents
our accepting of it, as a Probability next to a Certainty, of this being a
true Account; and there is only wanting, to our receiving it absolutely
as such, that the Copy be produced from which the Translation was
made, or a full and compleat Evidence as to what is become of such
Copy.</p>

<p>Why we cannot obtain a particular Information as to the original Letter
of <i>de Fonte</i>, appears from the Account, which shews that the Court
of <i>Spain</i> had a secret Intelligence of this Undertaking. And as that
Court would not openly declare that they had such an Information, or
how they intended to defeat the Design, the Orders sent, and consequently
the Account of the Execution of those Orders, and whatever
related thereto, would be <i>secret</i> Papers, and as such kept in a Manner
that few Persons would have a free Access; and by those few who had,
as the publick Business did not require it, might never be taken in
Hand, unless they accidentally catched the Eye of some who was particularly
curious. Thus neglected, in a Century of Time it might not be
known, if the Subject was revived, where they were deposited, and being
so few in Number would take up but a small Space, which might
make it difficult to find them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>The Politeness and Civility which prevail in this Age, will not admit
of such a Complaisance to curious Inquirers as to gratify them in that,
which, in Policy, from good Reasons of State, might as well be omitted.
There are Instances of late Discoveries being made, as to the
Whole of which, from particular Views, as it is said, the Curious have
not been gratified. And if this Expedition of <i>de Fonte</i> was remembered,
and the Papers relating thereto could be brought to light, it might immediately
encourage us to proceed on making a further Attempt for the
Discovery of a North-west Passage, therefore we can have no Reason to
expect the Court of <i>Spain</i> would assist us with what might determine us
to a Proceeding at which they must take Umbrage, as we are now become
the only Power who share <i>North America</i> with them, from the
Advantages that such a Discovery would give us in case of a future
Rupture between the two Crowns; though our present Intention is to
increase our Commerce, by opening a Trade to <i>Japan</i>, and carrying on
a Trade in a more advantageous Manner to <i>China</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot be assured, if full Permission was given to find these Papers,
and more particular Pains and Application used, than is customary
with People in publick Offices, when the Occasion of the Search
being to little other Purpose than satisfying Curiosity, whether such
Search might not be rendered unsuccessful, by such Papers being burnt
amongst many other State Papers, in the Fire in the <i>Escurial</i>, the common
Depository for State Papers at that Time.</p>

<p>If we consider the Changes that have happened, as to the Succession
to the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, the Changes in the Ministry, Foreigners introduced
into their Ministry, there must have been many Particulars, not
only of this but of other Kinds, which they are not at present acquainted
with, the Ministry having no Occasion to give themselves any Concern
about them. <i>Don Olivarez</i>, who was the Minister at this Time, was
known to do his Business by Juntos of particular People, as the Resolutions
of Government thereby remained an inviolable Secret, which
was not always the Case when the Business was managed by publick
Councils. They also gave their Advice in a particular Manner, by
written Billets, which were handed to the King, that every Thing was
conducted in a very mysterious Manner during the Time that he was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the Ministry, contrary to the former Practice, and which was also disused
afterwards.</p>

<p>If Inquiry hath been made by the most intelligent amongst the <i>Spaniards</i>
as to this Expedition, and the Commands of the Monarch to make
Discovery of these Papers, and the Orders relating thereto, have been
duly executed, but they cannot be found. The Reasons are apparent,
the Voyage being scarce spoke of at the Time, went soon out of Remembrance,
and whatever may be in private Hands relating thereto, is not
immediately recollected by the Possessors, and the Originals, if not secreted
or mislaid, are burnt in the <i>Escurial</i> in the Year 1671, the usual
Residence of the Court, and therefore where this Letter may be supposed
to be received and lodged. For the Evidence relative to this
Account, which the Distance of Time or other Accidents could not
deface, yet remains. If <i>de Fonte</i> was Governor or President of <i>Chili</i>,
from the Nature of his Office it must appear, amongst some Records
or Instruments of Writing, and we accordingly are informed, that
there was a Person in that Office named <i>Fuente</i>, which is synonymous.
That we have not more minute Particulars, is by reason that the Account
is from those Parts where we have not a free and ready Access
to make our Enquiries, and from a People, excepting a few Individuals,
who are not very communicative to Foreigners. But where we have not
laboured under the like Disadvantage, we have found that there was
one <i>Gibbons</i>, also <i>Shapley</i>, Persons exactly circumstanced as the Letter
mentions, upon the Authority of Records, the Tradition of antient
Men, in those Parts where they had lived, and also other Accounts, supporting
the Authenticity of this Letter, as will be shewn when we proceed
to consider of the Subject of the Letter. There is therefore just
Reason to conclude, was it possible to have the like Pains taken in <i>New
Spain</i> or <i>Peru</i>, we might meet with Particulars respecting this Matter,
which would put the Truth of this Account out of all Doubt; and
any Failure in the Inquiries there, may be owing to their not having
been made with an equal Industry, and which it is not in our Power
to procure in those Parts so distant and inaccessable.</p>

<p>The Circumstances of the Inhabitants of <i>Boston</i>, and the neighbouring
Provinces, during this Period of Time since the Expedition of <i>de Fonte</i>, have
been very different, they have not been subjected to the like fatal Accidents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
with the People of <i>Lima</i>, and that Neighbourhood, who several Times have
had their City laid in Ruins, and almost entirely depopulated by Earthquakes,
particularly in <i>April</i> 1687, and in the Year 1746. The Buildings
becoming an entire Heap of Ruins, and many People perishing,
must lessen the Force of Tradition, and affect, in some sort, the publick
Records; and if the Marine Office was at the <i>Calloa</i> of <i>Lima</i>, the
<i>Calloa</i> having been twice overwhelmed by the Sea, then there is no
Reason to expect from <i>New Spain</i> an authenticated Account of the
Equipment of this Fleet under the Command of Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>.</p>

<p>Those who argue against the Authenticity of this Account, must admit
that he was a Person of Capacity and Abilities who composed it,
and should assign us some Reason, if a Fiction, why a sensible Person
should undertake it, as there could be no Inducement either in Point
of Reputation or Profit: For, if a Fiction, it is neither entertaining or
instructive. Neither can any political Motive be urged for this Undertaking,
as the Subject must then have been treated in a Manner entirely
different; so managed as to shew that a North-west Passage was absolutely
impracticable, and to let nothing be introduced that would afford
the least Incitement to Adventurers to come into those Parts. But it
is apparent, that in this Account the Facts are related in a plain and
simple Manner, without any Violation of Truth, as they are related
without any Consideration of their Consequences. The Representations
made, as to the Tides, as to the different Sorts of Fish that came into
the Waters from Westward and Eastward, would have been an Encouragement
to a further Trial as to a North-west Passage, had such Account
been published; and if the Phænomena as to the Tides, and the
Difference as to the Fish, was not from its communicating with the <i>South
Sea</i>, and the Attempt had proved successless as to the Discovery of a
North-west Passage, yet to countervail, in some Measure, that Disappointment,
there was a Prospect of a lucrative Trade, in all Appearance
to be carried on in those Western Parts where <i>de Fonte</i> is represented to
have been in, with greater Convenience than that which had been carried
on by the <i>Boston</i> People from the East before and at this Time in
<i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, and the <i>English</i> might be invited, if successful in their
Trading, to make a Settlement, an Event which the <i>Spaniards</i> were apprehensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
of, and earnestly desirous to prevent. These are Defects
which the Capacity and Abilities of the Author would not permit him
to run into, if he was writing a fictitious Account, as he must easily see
that such Representations to destroy the Notion of a North-west Passage,
and prevent the <i>English</i> settling there, were absolutely contrary to his
Purpose. To give a greater Plausibility to a fictitious Tale, the Scene
may be laid in distant Parts, by this Means introducing, more securely,
Names and Characters of Persons as real who never were; and though
this Account mentions Persons who lived at a great Distance, and in an
obscure Part, yet there were such Persons as the Account mentions.
Also the Period of Time when this Voyage was performed, so corresponds
with their Transactions, as the Author could fix on no other Period
so agreeing with the Circumstance of Major <i>Gibbons</i> being so long,
and at that very Time, absent from home; and his Absence can be attributed
to no other Cause than his being out on a Voyage. Here is
more Plainness and Consistency than is usual in Fiction, with such a Variety
of Particulars, and so circumstanced, as would perplex the most
pregnant Fancy to invent, which can be no Way so naturally accounted
for as by admitting that the Letter contains a genuine Account of a
Voyage made by Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>, not a Forgery to support political
Views; or that it is the Production of a sporting Fancy to contrast some
other Performance, or in order to expose the Credulous to publick
Ridicule.</p>

<p>The Editors of this Letter, whose Business it was to know whether
this Account was authentick, gave an entire Credit to it as being authentick,
not only as they assured the Publick in a general Way, and
with respect to all their Pieces that they should publish, that they would
only exhibit such as were of unquestionable Authority, but by their annexing
an Advertisement to the Letter, have given us a particular Assurance
of the Account being authentick; and we have just Reason to
conclude they <i>could</i> have given us that further Satisfaction we now desire;
but what they have done was thought by them sufficient, as they
had no Idea of the <i>Importance</i> of the Subject. They comprehended not
further of this Account, <i>Than that it contained many curious and unknown
Discoveries; and they humbly presumed</i>, being Strangers to any further
Merit that it had, <i>that it would not, on that Account, be unacceptable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the Publick</i>. Had this Letter been published at a Time a North-west
Passage was under Consideration of the Publick, there might be some
Suspicion that the Editors had some further Design. But as to a North-west
Passage after the Voyage of Captain <i>James</i>, and after the Discovery
was entrusted to a Company, and no Success consequent, it was generally
received, many Years before this Letter was published, that to
find such a Passage was a Thing impracticable. The Opinion of there
being such a Passage was treated as a Chimera: And the Affair of a
North-west Passage lay in a State of Silence and Oblivion near thirty
Years after the Publication was made. We may observe, that there is
no Art in the Composition of this Advertisement; it was inserted by
Men of Honour and Veracity, who had no other Intention in publishing
these Memoirs than the Advancement of Science; who, from their
general Knowledge, could not be imposed on, and cannot, from their
known Characters, be supposed to have a Design to impose on others.
And what further or other Evidence than that which they have given
could be expected from the Editors, unless they had been acquainted
with the Importance which the Letter now appears to be of? It was all
that was at that Time necessary, as they did not expect that there would
be any invidious Imputation of Forgery, for then they would have vindicated
it from all Suspicion in a more particular Manner than they have
done. They thought it a sufficient Proof of its Authenticity their receiving
it into their Collection. As to that mean Reflection that this
Account is a Forgery of some <i>Englishman</i>, it is thoroughly obviated if
we consider on what a Foundation such a Supposition must be grounded,
which is, That some <i>Englishman</i> composed this Account, translated it into
<i>Spanish</i>, though there were but few and very indifferent Linguists at that
Time in <i>England</i>, to be again translated by the Editors, the better to
impose on them and the Publick. The Publick is a Name which comprehends
many Persons of Curiosity and Sagacity, for whom chiefly these
Memoirs were published; and by these Persons, as well as by all others,
the Account was received at that Time as genuine, without the least
Suspicion of there being any Fraud or Imposture.</p>

<p>The principal Object or Design of the Publication was, that the Account
contained a Discovery made of those Parts, as to the Knowledge of
which the Geographers were at that Time very deficient; and the Editors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
being satisfied as to the Authenticity, all they thought necessary was to
give a Translation of the Letter. And, from their Avocations to their
own private Affairs, did not consider it in so minute a Manner as it required,
as is plain from their Apology made as to the Stile of the Letter,
not being <i>altogether so polite, being wrote like a Man whose Livelihood
depended on another Way, and with an Abundance of Experience</i>. Whereas
the Politeness of Stile would have been an absolute Objection as to the
Authenticity of the Account. That as it was a Letter wrote by Admiral
<i>de Fonte</i> to lay before the Court of <i>Spain</i>, what had passed in the
Course of the Voyage, though <i>de Fonte</i> might express himself in proper
and well chosen Terms, yet he was to use a Stile that was natural
and simple. On the several Lights in which the Editors have been considered,
as to the Part which they undertook, it must appear that they
are unjustly reproached with Want of Integrity; they acted consistently,
having no Occasion to say more with respect to this Account than they
have done. Their Neglect was not from Want of Penetration or Design.
Their genuine Characters were such as they could not suppose it would
be ever suspected, that they could have any Inducement to impose a
spurious Account on the Publick.</p>

<p>Those who censure this Account of <i>de Fonte</i> as a Cheat and a Forgery
imposed by some one on the World, have produced no Evidence from
Facts, or urged any Thing to shew the Improbability of this Account;
as to the Argument they so strongly insist on that the Original was never
produced, it is highly improbable that the Original ever should be produced
in these Parts; and there is a Uniformity in the Circumstance
that a Copy only came to the Hands of the Editors, which turns the
Argument against the Objectors. The Suspicion of there being any
Deceit or Forgery, hath arose from there having been different Systems
advanced by Geographers respecting these Parts: Those in whose System
this Account is not adopted have been the Occasion of such Suspicions
being raised, and have given some Countenance to such their Suspicions
from the imperfect Manner in which this Account hath been exhibited;
though that is not to be attributed to the Account in its genuine Dress,
but as broken and disfigured by the Translator and Printer. The Glosses
and Comments added by the Person who took the Copy, and those added
by the Translator in Explanation of the Text, are inserted in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Character, and without any Distinction from the Text, and those by the
Translator ignorantly introduced. Marginal Notes are inserted as Part
of the Narration; Courses are omitted; others mistaken from the Translator's
Inattention to the <i>Spanish</i> Compass; Dates misplaced by the Printer:
The Translator also deviates from the Mode of Expression, and
renders, in an inaccurate, confused and obscure Manner, a very material
Part in this Account. Many of these Faults we may attribute to
Precipitation, from the Translator wanting due Time to study the Letter,
occasioned by a Persecution of the Printer, who pressed him to
finish that the Printer might compleat his monthly Number, and, from
the same Necessity, the immediate Publication, it may be that the Faults
of the Press are so many. Such numerous Defects make it evident that
this Account could never have been originally constructed in this Manner;
and it is on these Defects only that they rely, or from which their
principal Arguments are drawn to invalidate the Authenticity of this
Account. They might have perceived that a Relation, so mutilated
and impaired, must have had a more uniform or regular Shape at one
Time or other: And the Editors, in their Index, when the Year's Numbers
were compleated, stile it <i>an original and very entertaining Letter of
Admiral de Fonte</i>, by which they mean for the Curious; and by stiling
it an Original, they are not only to be understood that it was never before
published, but also that it was wrote by <i>de Fonte</i>; which implies
that they had a <i>Spanish</i> Account, and of which, as being consistent with
their Purpose, they gave only a Translation: Also the Impression of the
first Part, being so uncorrect and full of Faults, the second Part more
correct, and the Mode of Expression resumed, shews that the first Composition
is not their own, but that it is a Translation which the Editors
have given us. The Defects and Imperfections of which being pointed
out, we shall comprehend what little Reason there is to dispute the Authenticity
of this Account, from the Disfigurements which have prevented
our seeing it in its proper Shape, and for suspecting those Persons
to be Authors of the Fiction who meant well; but their Fault consisted
in their Inattention to the Translator, who did not therefore give a successful
Conclusion to their good Design, as by rendering the Account
obscure and unintelligible, he afforded Matter for Cavil and Dispute as
to this Account of the Voyage, whether credible or not, and which a
just Translation would have confirmed to be true.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>As to the Name <i>Bartholomew de Fonte</i>, we may observe that when the
Translator can render the Names in the <i>Spanish</i> by <i>English</i> Names which
are answerable thereto, he doth not insert the <i>Spanish</i> Names, but the
<i>English</i>. Thus, as to the Ships, he calls one the King <i>Philip</i>; but when
they cannot be rendered by a resembling Denomination in the <i>English</i>,
and the Name hath its Original from the <i>Latin</i>, he passes by the new
Name, or as it is wrote in the <i>Spanish</i>, and gives us the antient Name,
or according to the Latin <i>St. Spiritus</i>, <i>St. Lucia</i>, <i>Rosaria</i>, for <i>de Espiritu
Santo</i>, <i>Santa Lucia</i>, <i>del Rosaria</i>. Hath rendered <i>Bartholomew de Fonte</i>,
<i>Philip de Ronquillo</i> both in <i>English</i> and <i>Latin</i>. From which Management
of the Translator, in giving the Name according to the <i>Latin</i> and
not giving it as it hath been transformed or changed agreeable to the
<i>Spanish</i> Orthography, there is just Reason to conclude the Name which
is here rendered <i>Fonte</i>, was <i>Fuente</i> or <i>Fuentes</i> in the Original. But if it
was wrote <i>Fonte</i>, it was in the provincial Dialect, different from the
Manner of writing the good Writers introduced, which did not immediately
prevail in all Parts alike, but was gradually received. For Instance,
they wrote <i>Fuenterabia</i> in <i>Castile</i>, when the <i>Biscayners</i> continued to write
<i>Fonterabia</i>; and it is as often spelt the one Way as the other in our
Books and Maps.</p>

<p><i>Fuente</i> and <i>Fuentes</i> are not of one Termination. <i>Fonte</i> or <i>Fuente</i>, in
the Titles of the <i>Marquis Aguila de Fuente</i>, so in <i>de Fuente de Almexi</i>, is
of the singular Number, or the Title is taken from the Water of <i>Almexi</i>.
But <i>Fuentes</i>, in the Titles of the <i>Marquis de Fuentes</i>, and in <i>Conde Fuentes
de Valde Pero</i>, or of <i>Don Pedro Enriques Conde de Fuentes</i>, expresses a plural
Number, which the Translator, through his Indifference as to the
Subject which he was employed to translate, might not observe.</p>

<p><i>Don Pedro Enriques Conde de Fuentes</i> was raised to the Honour of being
a Grandee by <i>Philip</i> the Third, in the Year 1615, in respect to his great
Services in the Wars; was descended from a Branch of that illustrious
Family the <i>Enriques</i>. Nine of which Family were successively Admirals
of <i>Castile</i>; and the ninth, <i>Don Joan Alonso Enriques</i>, was in that high
Post at the Time of this Expedition. There were Intermarriages between
the Families of <i>Enriques</i> and <i>Valasco</i>; and <i>Don Pedro</i> was succeeded
in his Estate and Title by <i>Don Luis de Haro</i>, of the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
House of <i>Valasco</i>, and Son-in-Law to <i>Don Olivarez</i>. These Circumstances
considered, we have a further Reason to suspect that the Name
<i>de Fonte</i> is not duly rendered by the Translator, as there is a Consistency
in a Relation of the <i>Conde de Fuentes</i> being advanced to be Admiral of
<i>New Spain</i> and <i>Peru</i>, which coincides with what is reported from <i>New
Spain</i>, of the Name being <i>Fuentes</i> of the Person who was President of <i>Chili</i>.
It was also apparent that <i>de Fonte</i> was a Man of Family, from those who
took the respective Commands under him. <i>Pennelossa</i>, of whom more
particular mention is made in the Letter: <i>Philip de Ronquillo</i>, seemingly
allied to <i>John de Ronquillo</i>, who did considerable Service in the Year
1617, and was Governor of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. There was also <i>Ronquillo</i>
a Judge, sent to reduce the Insurgents at the City of <i>Segovia</i>, in
the Time of the Civil Wars in <i>Spain</i>. <i>Pedro de Bonardæ</i>, who is afterwards
called Captain <i>Barnarda</i>: Of him we must have the least to say;
and we could not expect to be any Way successful in our Inquiries from
this Inaccuracy. He seems not to have had so distinguished an Alliance
as the others, and employed on this Expedition on the Account of his
Abilities, being allotted to a Service not like that of <i>Pennelossa</i>, or <i>Ronquillo</i>,
disagreeable in respect to the Climate, fatiguing and hazardous.
That he was a Gentleman by his Descent, is evident from his being
named <i>de Bonardæ</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Spanish</i> Fleet was but in a mean Condition at the Conclusion of
the Ministry of the Duke of <i>Lerma</i>; but when an Expedition was set
out to recover <i>St. Salvador</i> in the Year 1626, was much improved; the
<i>Portuguese</i> had twenty-six Sail, but the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet were now numerous.
It doth not appear that the Fleets from <i>Lisbon</i>, when <i>Portugal</i> was under
the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, were sent otherwhere than to the <i>East Indies</i>,
<i>Brazil</i>, and the Perlieus; and those from <i>Old Spain</i>, that sailed from
<i>Cadiz</i>, went to <i>New Spain</i>, and the Islands under that Dominion. In
the Year 1596, when Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> took <i>Cadiz</i>, he burnt the Fleet
that was lying there bound for <i>Mexico</i>; and Mr. <i>Gage</i>, in the Year
1625, sailed with a Fleet of sixteen Sail, all for <i>Mexico</i>, and to the
<i>West Indies</i> seventeen Sail, besides eight Galleons for a Convoy, all
under two <i>Spanish</i> Admirals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>The Inconsistency that <i>de Fonte</i>, a <i>Portugueze</i>, should be in such a
Post as <i>Admiral of New Spain</i>, a great Objection to the Authenticity of
this Account, is removed by the Observations that have been made as
to the Name <i>de Fonte</i>, by which it appears that he was not a <i>Portugueze</i>,
and their having Sea Commanders, <i>Spaniards</i> by Birth, with whom they
could supply the principal Posts in the Marine, without being under the
Necessity of applying to <i>Portugal</i> for Persons qualified to fill those
Stations.</p>

<p>As to <i>de Fonte</i> being afterwards President of <i>Chili</i>, it is meant of the
<i>Audience of Chili</i>, subordinate to the <i>Viceroy of Peru</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="REMARKS" id="REMARKS">REMARKS</a><br />

<small>ON<br />

The LETTER of Admiral DE FONTE.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Viceroys of <i>New Spain</i> and <i>Peru</i>, having Advice from the
Court of <i>Spain</i>, and not from <i>the Court</i> and the <i>Council of Spain</i>;
which latter is the common Form of Expression used in any Matter
which had been under the Consideration of the <i>Supreme Council of the
Indies</i>, implies that such Advice must have proceeded from the Secret
Council, or from the King through his Minister, that the Design of
the Equipment of the four Ships, and the Attempt of the Industrious
Navigators from <i>Boston</i> might remain a Secret.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Appellation of Industrious Navigators was conformable to the
Characters of <i>Gibbons</i> and <i>Shapley</i>. Sir <i>Thomas Button</i>, in the Extract
which there is from his Journal, gives <i>Gibbons</i> a great Eulogium as to
his being an able Navigator; and this was the Character of <i>Shapley</i>
amongst his Cotemporaries.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>Spain</i> knew that this Attempt to discover a Passage
between the <i>Atlantick</i> and the <i>Western Ocean</i>, was intended by the Northward
and Westward; and though they allude to all the Attempts to
make such Discovery which had been at any Time made, by mentioning
the several Reigns in which any such Attempts were made, yet they
hint more particularly, that they expect this Attempt will be by <i>Hudson</i>'s
Bay, as they mention expresly in their Advice the two Voyages of <i>Hudson</i>
and <i>James</i>. For what is here said, <i>That the several Attempts</i>, &amp;c. is
a Recital from the Advice sent by the Court to the Viceroys, or from
the Orders that <i>de Fonte</i> received.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>This Expedition from <i>Boston</i> particularly commanded the Attention
of the Court of <i>Spain</i>, as Captain <i>James</i> had not absolutely denied there
was a North-west Passage; and <i>Fox</i>, though not mentioned here, had
published an Account in 1635, by which he had positively declared
that there was a North-west Passage; and Sir <i>Thomas Button</i>, who kept
his Journal a Secret, was very confident of a Passage, and is said to
have satisfied King <i>James</i> the First. The Death of his Patron <i>Prince
Henry</i> prevented his being fitted out again. <i>Gibbons</i>, his Intimate, had
made the Voyage with him: Afterwards had made a second Attempt by
himself, but lost his Season by being detained in the Ice. And now,
though a married Man, had a Family, a Person in Trust and Power
where he resided, engages in a third Attempt from <i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p><i>The second, third, and fourth Year of the Reign of King Charles</i> refers
solely to the Voyage of Captain <i>James</i>; to the Time he was engaging
Friends to fit him out; and the Time when such Voyage was concluded on.
As the <i>English</i> used the <i>Julian</i>, and the <i>Spaniards</i> the <i>Gregorian</i> Account,
these Transactions which refer to Captain <i>James</i>'s Expedition, could not
be made to coalesce as to the Time, from the Difference there was between
these two Computations, in any other Manner than by putting
the Year of the King of <i>England</i>'s Reign. As King <i>Charles</i> began his
Reign the 27th of <i>March</i> 1625, two Days after the Commencement
of the Year, according to the <i>Julian</i> Account, and the second Year of
his Reign would not begin until the 27th of <i>March</i> 1626, two Days
also after that Year commenced, but according to the <i>Gregorian</i> Account,
the Year 1626 began in <i>January</i>; from the 1st of <i>January</i> to
the 27th of <i>March</i>, the Year 1626, according to the <i>Gregorian</i> Account,
would correspond with the first Year of the Reign of King <i>Charles</i>. As
to this Expedition from <i>Boston</i>, it is mentioned to be in the Year 1639,
and in the fourteenth Year of the Reign of King <i>Charles</i>; but the Year
1639, according to the <i>Julian</i> Account, is the fifteenth Year of that
King's Reign; but according to the <i>Gregorian</i> Account, the Year 1639
corresponds from <i>January</i> to <i>March</i> with the fourteenth Year of that
King's Reign.</p>

<p>The Times mentioned in this Letter do not refer to the Times when
the Voyages were actually set out on, but when undertaken or resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
on, as it is expressed in the Letter, <i>undertaken</i> by some industrious Navigators
from <i>Boston</i>. Captain <i>James</i> did not sail until the Year one
Thousand six Hundred and Thirty-one, not getting the King's Protection
early enough in one Thousand six Hundred and Thirty, to proceed
that Year, or in the fourth Year of the King's Reign. That is, he did
not get it early enough in Spring to be ready by the latter End of
<i>March</i>, as he must have been to proceed that Year; so the fourth Year
of the King well agrees with this Proceeding. And <i>de Fonte</i> did not sail
until one Thousand six Hundred and Forty, which was a Year after the
Court of <i>Spain</i> had received Intelligence of such Undertaking from <i>Boston</i>.
Which they would use the first Opportunity to transmit to <i>New Spain</i>; <i>de
Fonte</i> therefore had at least six Months for the Equipment of the four
Ships to go on this Expedition; a Time sufficient, in so fine a Climate,
and every Thing that was necessary to be done was enforced by Orders of
the Crown. Had this Equipment been executed in a much smaller Space
of Time, there would have been nothing so admirable in it: Therefore
the Objection, as to the Impossibility that Ships should be fitted between
the Time the Court received this Information, and their sailing,
drops to the Ground.</p>

<p>It is not any way strange that this Design, as it appears to have been,
was made known to the Court of <i>Spain</i> the Year before that it was set
out on; as that Court entertained a continual Jealousy of these Undertakings,
as is apparent from their sending Vessels to intercept <i>Davis</i>;
their having Informations as to Captain <i>James</i>'s Voyage also, and the
Consequences of it, as may be collected from this Letter.</p>

<p>Major General <i>Gibbons</i>, if he had not the King's Protection, yet he
had Friends at the Court of <i>England</i> who made Application for him to
be Captain of the Fort at <i>Boston</i>, and one of the Council, the latter End
of the Year one Thousand six Hundred and Thirty-eight, or in the Beginning
of the Year one Thousand six Hundred and Thirty-nine. That the
most secret Affairs of the Court were at that Time betrayed, I believe
will be admitted, and the Secret of his designed Attempt might be known,
by his applying for Leave of Absence from his Post during the Time that
he should be engaged in this Undertaking. Or the Persons with whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
corresponded in <i>England</i> might be apprized of his intended
Voyage, he could not, at that Time of Day, be supplied with every Thing that
was necessary thereto in <i>America</i>; and as he intended to trade, he would
be for procuring his Goods from <i>England</i>. By some of these Means probably
his Design perspired, and was secretly and unexpectedly, transmitted
to the Court of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>There are several Reasons to be assigned why both Viceroys should
be informed, not only the Viceroy of <i>Peru</i>, in whose District the Ships
were to be fitted, but the Viceroy of <i>New Spain</i> also. That if a Passage
was made by any other Way than where the Ships were to be stationed
to intercept the <i>Boston</i> Men, or they accidentally passed such Ships, the
Viceroys might order a Look-out also to be kept. And such a Provision
being made, it would be scarce possible, if a Passage was obtained, that the
<i>Boston</i> People should get clear out of those Seas, and not fall into the
Hands of the <i>Spaniards</i>. Another Reason is, that such Particulars as <i>de
Fonte</i> was to put in for on the Coast of <i>Mexico</i> might be ready, that <i>de
Fonte</i> might not meet with the least Delay, as such Delay might occasion
the Disappointment of his Design.</p>

<p>The Letter proceeds, 'Upon which, I Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>, received
Orders from <i>Spain</i> and the Viceroys to equip four Ships of Force.'
These Words, <i>upon which</i>, I understand not to allude to the Advice
given the Viceroys, but refer to the Attempt intended from <i>Boston</i>, and
as to which he had received his Orders from <i>Spain</i>. But from the Viceroys
he received Orders only as to the Equipment of the four Ships, as
Orders of that Nature would regularly proceed from them. If it was
otherwise, and he had also received his Orders from them, containing
Instructions as to the Conduct of his Voyage, he would have made his
Report to the Viceroys as to the Manner in which he had conducted his
Voyage, and they would have reported it to the Court.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> mentioning the Viceroys so simply and plainly, without any
respectful or distinguishing Additions, is an Instance that this Letter was
wrote to the Court of <i>Spain</i>, it not being proper, in a Letter so addressed,
to mention the Viceroys in any other Manner; and as it is also
evident from the Expression, <i>I Admiral de Fonte</i>, that he did not write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
this Letter in his private Capacity, but as an Admiral, therefore this
Letter could not be otherwhere addressed than to such Court, to transmit
an Account how he had executed these Orders, which he had
received immediately from <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> mentioning that the Advice which the Viceroys received was
from the Court of <i>Spain</i>, and that the Orders he received were from <i>Spain</i>,
carries a Distinction with it as though the Advice and the Orders were
not transmitted from the same Persons. Those who transmitted the Advice
to the Viceroys were not seemingly in the Secret, as to the particular
Orders or Instructions which were sent to <i>de Fonte</i>, as to the Manner
in which he was to conduct his Voyage. It was the Province of the
Admiral of <i>Castile</i>, who was stiled Captain General of the Sea, who was
subject to no Controul but the King's, to issue all Orders relative to
maritime Affairs, and therefore <i>de Fonte</i>'s Orders might come from him.
Or otherwise these Orders were immediately transmitted by the <i>Conde de
Olivarez</i>, who was on ill Terms with the Admiral, and regarded no
Forms, under the Sanction of the Favour he had with the King, whom
he influenced to authorize all his Measures. It is also consistent with the
Conduct of <i>Don Olivarez</i> that this Affair should be managed in this
Manner, who was always mysterious, confided in his own Judgment,
singular in his Manners, and therefore was called a Lover of Projects,
and supposed a meer Visionary in some of them. He did not want for
Persons of the greatest Abilities to assist him, and the Accuracy with which
the Orders are composed that were sent to <i>de Fonte</i>, (as may be collected
from the Manner in which the Voyage is conducted, and in which it
cannot be supposed <i>de Fonte</i> was left to his Discretion) is an Instance
there had been no Want of the Assistance of able, sagacious and experienced
Persons in the composing of such Orders and Instructions.</p>

<p>The Design of this introductory Part is to shew the Proceedings in this
Affair previous to his Voyage; that the Advice was received, and the
Orders subsequent were obeyed; and it is drawn with peculiar Care and
a Conciseness which would be censured in a Voyage Writer, but is used
with the greatest Propriety on this Occasion.</p>

<p>The Names of the Ships are agreeable to the Manner that the <i>Spaniards</i>
name theirs; and by Ships of Force is not meant either their
Caracks or Galeons, but Country Ships, which the Equipment seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
imply, made defensible against any Attacks of the Natives, and to have
nothing to fear from the <i>Boston</i> Men, and these Ends could be obtained
in Vessels which had no great Draught of Water, as the Rivers
they were to pass up and the Lakes required, and of a Tonnage suitable
to those Northern Seas, therefore <i>de Fonte</i> only expresses their Names,
and their Commanders, says nothing of their Rates.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i>, in his Course from the <i>Callao</i> of <i>Lima</i>, and in all his subsequent
Courses through the Voyage, computes his Distance after the
Marine Manner, from that Land from where he takes his Departure to
the Land made when he enters a Harbour, or the Termination of the
Land which makes such Harbour to Seaward; and here takes his Departure
from the extreme Part of the <i>Callao</i> of <i>Lima</i>, which is in the
Latitude 11° 5´ S. Longitude 80° 39´ W. and from which to <i>St. Helena</i>,
being North of the Bay of <i>Guiaguil</i>, in Lat. 2° 5´ S. Long. 84° 6´ W. is
two hundred Leagues; and there is no Fault in the Impression, as hath
been supposed. Though these Words, <i>on the North Side of the Bay</i> of
<i>Guiaguil</i> seem to be an Interpolation.</p>

<p>The Distance said to be run between the <i>Callao</i> of <i>Lima</i> and <i>St. Helena</i>
is not reconcileable with the Accounts published by <i>Dampier</i>, <i>Wood
Rogers</i>, or the Accounts in general, excepting with a Copy of a <i>Spanish</i>
Manuscript, of the Latitudes and Longitudes of the most noted Places
in the <i>South Seas</i>, corrected from the latest Observations, by <i>Manuel
Monz. Prieto</i>, Professor of Arts in <i>Peru</i>, whose Computation of Longitude
is from the Meridian of <i>Paris</i>; but he fixes <i>Lima</i> at full eighty
Degrees. I use <i>Prieto</i>'s Tables in this, and principally in all my subsequent
Computations, though <i>de Fonte</i> no where mentions the Longitude
in this Letter, as he only regards the Difference of the Meridian
of <i>Lima</i>. And it by no Means invalidates but favours the Authenticity
of this Account, that <i>de Fonte</i> differs in his Computation from the
<i>English</i> and <i>French</i> Accounts at, and after those Times, which also differ
from each other, as they only ranged along the Coasts of those Seas,
judged of their Distances according to their Journals, and must have
made many vague Observations, as to the Latitude of Places, by Inspection
of the Land from Sea, and which Land they might not certainly
know. Their best Directions they got from Manuscript Journals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
or Sea Waggoners, composed for their own Use by Coasters. But the
navigating of the King's Ships were better provided for in this respect;
and we may well suppose that <i>de Fonte</i> was not, on this Occasion, deficient
in Artists well versed in the Theory as well as the Practice of Navigation,
and under this Character of an Artist we may consider <i>Parmentiers</i>.
The Truth, as to the Latitude, once fixed is not variable by
Time; and in this respect <i>de Fonte</i> and <i>Prieto</i> must agree, though a
Century between the Time of their Computations.</p>

<p>The Expression, 'anchored in the Port of <i>St. Helena</i> (in <i>Spanish</i>, <i>Santa
Elena</i>) <i>within the Cape</i>,' hath something more particular in it than
appears on a transient View. The Point of <i>St. Helena</i> is thus described
in the sailing Directions in the <i>Atlas Maritimus</i>, published in 1728. 'The
Point itself is high, but as you come nearer in there is a lower Point
runs out sharpening towards the Sea. And there are two distinct Anchorages
within this Port, one within the lower Point, here Vessels ride
without Shelter, and amongst Banks and Shoals. Under the high
Land, there is the other Anchorage, deep Water, and secure riding.'
Under this high Land, being called the Port within the Cape, is a Distinction
which I do not find made by the Voyage Writers, or in any
other of the sailing Directions for these Parts that I have seen; and <i>de
Fonte</i> particularly mentions, as it may be supposed, being in Conformity
with his Instructions.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> taking in the <i>Betumen</i> must have been in pursuance of his
Instructions, and there provided for him by Order of the Viceroy.</p>

<p>That which follows, called vulgarly Tar, <i>&amp;c.</i> seems to be an Interpolation,
or additional Comment, though not distinguished as such; and
it may be observed here is a different Mode of Expression, and a Want
of that Conciseness which apparently precedes. If with these Words took
<i>a Quantity of Betumen</i>, we connect <i>on the 10th we passed the Equinoctial</i>,
then that Conciseness and Simplicity of the Narration is preserved. It
is inconsistent that <i>de Fonte</i> should inform the Court, that it was not for
Want of Tar that he put into this Port, and that he did not procure
this <i>Betumen</i> to use instead of Tar, but to make Use of it as Medicine.
The taking the <i>Betumen</i> aboard sufficiently intimated his Compliance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
with his Instructions. The Expression, <i>we took it in for Medicine</i>, hath
something particular in it, seems to be a Note or Memorandum added
by some Person who made the Voyage, to instruct a Friend for whom
he made, or to whom he gave, a Copy of this Letter.</p>

<p>The one Degree seven Minutes of Latitude is misplaced, Cape <i>St.
Francisco</i> being by no Geographers or Voyage Writers placed in that
Latitude; the one Degree seven Minutes is the Latitude of the River
<i>St. Jago</i>, and which <i>Prieto</i> lays down in one Degree eight Minutes.</p>

<p>As to the Courses and Distances eighty Leagues N. N. W. and twenty-five
Leagues E. and by S. which were placed in the Margin in the first
Edition, but are since crept into the Text. N. N. W. is a Course entirely
contrary, and instead of one there is two Courses, North and
North East, and which two Courses are consistent with the E. and by S.
Course twenty-five Leagues, as that Course will then terminate in the
Latitude and Longitude of the River <i>Jago</i>. This Error of North West
for North East may be accounted for by remarking, that in the <i>Spanish</i>
Compass North East and North West are rendered <i>Nord Este</i> and <i>Nord
Oeste</i>: The Omission of the <i>O</i> in <i>este</i> is a Fault which may be committed
even by a careful Transcriber, or may be a Mistake in the Translator,
for Want of due Attention to the Compass.</p>

<p>In the Passage from <i>St. Helena</i> he would keep the Coast aboard, for
the Benefit of a fair and fresh Wind, and which he would have without
any Interruption from the Land Breezes, and by standing N. W. to
clear the Islands of <i>Solango</i> and <i>Paita</i>, and then stand North Easterly
would form a North Course of one Hundred and Thirty-two Miles, or
forty-four Leagues, and then be off Cape <i>Passao</i>, in N. Lat. 8´. Long.
83° 59´ W. and well in with such Cape, as it is evident he was from
the Expression in the Letter by the Cape <i>del Passao</i> with a North East
Course, thirty-six Leagues, they would be in Lat. 1° 23´ North, Long.
82° 50´, and so have passed Cape <i>Francisco</i>, N. Lat. 50´, Long. 82° 55´,
and with an East and by South Course twenty-five Leagues, would be in
the Lat. 1° 8´, Long. 81° 36´, the Latitude and Longitude of the River
<i>St. Jago</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>There was not such a Provision Country, it appears from later Accounts,
on any Part of the Coast between this and <i>Lima</i>; nor could the
Ships be any where brought up with greater Safety: <i>St. Helena</i> is described
as a poor and barren Part of the Country.</p>

<p>The Health of his People, liable to scorbutick Disorders in the northern
Climates whither he was going, was an Object that must be attended
to, in order that the Voyage should meet with the desired Success.
Therefore after the <i>Betumen</i>, he recruits what he had consumed of
his fresh Provision in his run from <i>Lima</i>, and lays in a great additional
Store, as is apparent if we consider that their Consumption in this respect
is not proportionable to ours, from their Mode of dressing it. And
we may judge from having so great a Quantity of Fowl ready, with
Goats and Hogs, the People had received Orders to be thus provided
against the Ships Arrival; the Sailors would be a great Assistance
in curing the Provisions, the Flesh as well as the Fish, and would do
it in the most suitable Manner for the Sea Service; a Number of
Hands, gave an Expedition so as the Provisions would not be spoiled
by the Heat of the Sun; and his Victualling detained <i>de Fonte</i> four
Days.</p>

<p><i>Six Miles and a half, or the Left Hand the River is navigable for small
Vessels</i>, and all that follows seems by Way of Comment, and to be a
spurious Interpolation, as also, <i>which are there wild and in plenty</i>.</p>

<p>'The 16th of <i>April</i> we sailed from the River of <i>St. Jago</i> to the Port
and Town <i>Raleo</i>, 320 Leagues W. N. W. a little westerly, in about
11 Degrees 14 Min. of N. Latitude, leaving Mount <i>St. Miguel</i>, &amp;c.'</p>

<p>The Point of <i>Yeaxos</i>, or the <i>Sandy Strand</i>, in Lat. 11° 58´, Long.
93° 31´, which covers the Port of <i>Raleo</i> (or <i>Realejo</i>) is three Hundred
and twenty Leagues from the River <i>St. Jago</i>; but the Course N. 47°
30´ W. or N. W. almost a Quarter West, and by the Expression <i>a little</i>
Westerly, the W. N. W. seems to mean, he steered first West from the
River <i>St. Jago</i>, until he made the high Land, and then North-west,
a little Westerly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>Between Mount <i>Miguel</i> and Point <i>Cazarnina</i> (rightly <i>Caravina</i>) is the
Entrance in the Bay of <i>Amapalla</i>, which is to the Northward of the
Port of <i>Realejo</i>; therefore the leaving Mount <i>St. Miguel</i> on the Larboard,
<i>&amp;c.</i> being an absolute Contradiction to <i>de Fonte</i> entering the Port
of <i>Realejo</i>, is an Interpolation and not inserted by the Person who wrote
the Letter, but a Comment very injudiciously added by Way of Explanation.
From this Circumstance the Truth of my Assertion appears,
as to there being Glosses and Comments added to the original Text,
and that I had good Reason to believe several Places in the preceding
Part of this Account to be Interpolations added by Way of Comment.</p>

<p>The great Ships that are built in <i>New Spain</i> are built in <i>Raleo</i> is disposed
in the Margin in the first Edition; but in all the subsequent Editions
hath crept into the Text. We may suppose the W. N. W. Course
hath crept into the Text in the first Edition to make room for this
Comment, as may be judged from the Course between <i>St. Helena</i> and
<i>St. Jago</i> being placed in the Margin: And there is an apparent Reason
for the Course and Distances being so placed, for when inserted in
the Text, they interrupt the Attention; and as the Courses and Distances
were all that was necessary to be mentioned, the Latitudes have
been since added by some injudicious Person.&mdash;The Latitude of <i>Passao</i>,
of Cape <i>St. Francisco</i>, is not mentioned, and the Latitude of <i>Raleo</i> is
wrong, which the Course and Distance shews, and its Latitude is in
most Maps agreeable to the Course and Distance here given. The Run,
allowing <i>de Fonte</i> eight Days, would be but one hundred Miles in
twenty-four Hours, which is very moderate going. Nor can there be
any Objection, as to the Truth of this Account, from the Time that <i>de
Fonte</i> is sailing between the <i>Callao</i> of <i>Lima</i> to <i>St. Helena</i>, from <i>St. Helena</i>
to <i>St. Jago</i>.</p>

<p>All that belongs to the original Letter I take to be this, The 16th of
<i>April</i> we sailed from the River <i>St. Jago</i> to the Port and Town of <i>Raleo</i>;
here we bought (which probably might as well be rendered procured)
four long well-sailed Shallops, built express for sailing, riding at Anchor,
<i>&amp;c.</i> The 320 Leagues W. N. W. a little Westerly, I suppose to
have been placed in the Margin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that Boats so fitted, and four of them, could
be procured in so small a Time as <i>de Fonte</i> staid here, it implies they
were previously provided before that he arrived, to be ready at the Arrival
of the Ships.</p>

<p>'The <i>26th</i> we sailed from <i>Raleo</i> for the Port of <i>Saragua</i>, or rather of
<i>Salagua</i>, within the Islands and Shoals of <i>Chamily</i>, 480 Leagues
N. W. and by West, a little Westerly from <i>Raleo</i>. From the Town
of <i>Saragua</i>, a little East of <i>Chamily</i> at <i>Saragua</i>, and from <i>Compostilo</i> in
the Neighbourhood of this Port, we took in a Master and six Mariners
accustomed to trade with the Natives for Pearl the Natives
catched on a Bank in 19 Degrees of Latitude North from the <i>Baxos</i>
of <i>St. Juan</i> in 24 Degrees of North Latitude, 20 Leagues N. N. E.
from Cape <i>Saint Lucas</i>, the South-east Point of <i>California</i>.'</p>

<p>The Point of <i>Yeaxos</i> is laid down in Lat. 11 Deg. 58 Min. Long.
93 Deg. 31 Min. and with a Course North-west and by West, a little
Westerly, Distance four Hundred and eighty Leagues, <i>de Fonte</i> would be
at the Islands of <i>Chiametlas</i>, in Lat. 22 Deg. 10 Min. Long. 114 Deg.
29 Min.</p>

<p>The Port of <i>Saragua</i>, or rather of <i>Salagua</i> (which is properly <i>Zuelagua</i>)
is thus described. 'The Mount of <i>Sant Jago</i> is in the Port of
<i>Zuelagua</i>. There are two very good Harbours which have good anchoring
Ground, and will hold a great many Ships, by reason they are
great and are called the <i>Calletas</i>. On the North-west Side of the said
Bay is another very good Port, which is called likewise the Port of
<i>Zuelagua</i>. You will find in it a River of fresh Water, and several Plantations.
At the Sea Side is a Pathway that leads to the Town of <i>Zuelagua</i>,
being four and a half Miles from the Port within Land. Between
the Port of <i>Zuelagua</i> and the white Ferrelon (or Rock) is a very
good Port, in which you are Land-locked from all Winds.'</p>

<p>From this Description it is easy to comprehend what is <i>de Fonte</i>'s
Meaning as to the Port of <i>Zuelagua</i>, where he took in his Master and
Mariners on the North-west Side of the Bay, and which he expresses
by, at <i>Saragua</i> a little East of <i>Chamily</i>; and which Master and Mariners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
were not promiscuously taken, but were chosen Men, as they were
taken both from <i>Zuelagua</i> and <i>Compostilo</i>, in the Neighbourhood of the
Port. <i>Zuelagua</i> seems originally the City which was called <i>Xalisco</i>; but
from its unhealthy Situation, <i>Compostilo</i> was built more within Land;
yet the former continuing to be a Port, some Inhabitants remained
there.</p>

<p>The Islands and Shoals of <i>Chiametla</i>, which the Translation renders
<i>Chamily</i>, which is a Name given to Islands South of Cape <i>Corientes</i>.
But the Distinction is the Islands to Northward of Cape <i>Corientes</i> are
called <i>Chiametla</i>, those to Southward <i>Chametla</i> and <i>Camilli</i>. <i>Prieto</i> agrees
with <i>de Fonte</i>'s Account first mentioning the Islands of <i>Chiametlas</i> in Lat. 22. 10.
Long. 114. 29. and then <i>El mal Pays y mal outradu</i>.</p>

<p>This Master and Mariners were accustomed to trade with the Natives
for Pearl, which the Natives catched on a Bank in nineteen Degrees of
Latitude, being North from the <i>Baxos of St. Juan</i>, or the Bank of <i>St.
John</i>, which is in twenty-four Degrees of North Latitude, and twenty
Leagues North North-east from Cape <i>Saint Lucas</i>, the South-east Point
of <i>California</i>; and this Account <i>de Fonte</i> had either from themselves,
or the Character that was sent with them, to shew the most proper Persons
had been provided to answer the Purpose for which they were procured.
And all that belongs to the Text is, which the Natives catched
on a Bank North from the <i>Baxos St. Juan</i>, twenty Leagues N. N. E.
from Cape <i>St. Lucas</i>.</p>

<p>'The Master Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> had hired, with his Vessel and Mariners,
who had informed the Admiral that, 200 Leagues North from
Cape <i>St. Lucas</i>, a Flood from the North met the South Flood, and
that he was sure it must be an Island, and <i>Don Diego Pennelossa</i> undertook
to discover whether it was an Island or not, with his Ship and
the four Shallops they bought at <i>Raleo</i>, and the Master and Mariners
they hired at <i>Zuelagua</i>.'</p>

<p>Here the Thread of the Letter is broke, and the Translator proceeds
as with a common Narrative of a Voyage. The Master might be easily
deceived as to the Tide, as Time hath shewn in many Instances as to
other Persons having been deceived in like Manner in other Parts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
That we have no Account of what was the Event of this Expedition
<i>Pennelossa</i>, who had undertaken the Charge, being no more to join <i>de Fonte</i>,
as it was unnecessary and to no Purpose, <i>Pennelossa</i> would return first and
send his Account to Court. <i>De Fonte</i> could in this Case do no further
than shew he had sent him on this Service, it must be supposed, agreeable
to his Instructions. Which, from the Boats brought from <i>Realejo</i>,
(and must be of a particular Constructure, the like of which were not
to be any where else on the Coast) and the Master and Mariners hired
here, it is evident, was before proposed, that <i>Pennelossa</i> should go on this
Part of the Expedition, not on the Master's declaring that there was a
Tide from the Northward, and so <i>California</i> an Island. This was only
mentioned by <i>de Fonte</i>, to shew what Intelligence he had got in this
Affair.</p>

<p>The Account given of <i>Pennelossa</i> could be evidently no Part of the
Letter. What is said as to his Descent, his being a Nobleman, his Address
to Cosmography, and the Undertaking of this Discovery, must
evidence as already said, whoever inserted the Account was satisfied as
to their being such a Person so accomplished, and who aspired to undertake
this Part of the Expedition. A Discovery of these Parts would
carry, at this Time particularly, great Reputation and Honour with it,
and by this Opportunity to intercept Persons on a Design so prejudicial
to the Interests of the Court of <i>Spain</i> in those Parts, as it was then
thought, had <i>Pennelossa</i> succeeded; he would have had no small Share
of Merit; or if he did not succeed, the Merit of the Attempt would be
accounted of, and not unjustly, it would be a Means of his Promotion
through the Connections he had, as they would urge he did not pursue
those Sciences for Speculation only, but to carry them into Practice for
the Service of his Country. And according to the Regulations Don <i>Olivarez</i>
had made, there was no Preferment but what was in consequence
of Service.</p>

<p>Sister's Son of <i>Don Lewis de Haro</i>, and a young Nobleman, expresses
as of the Time present, when the Copy was taken from which we have
the Publication; and <i>Don Haro, Prime Minister of Spain</i>, was a Gloss
added by another Hand. Neither is <i>Don Luis de Haro</i> the Person here
meant, for he does not seem to have been of an Age to have had a
Sister who could be Mother to <i>Don Pennelossa</i>; but <i>Don Lopez de Haro</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
is the Person meant, <i>Marquis de Carpio</i>, the Father of <i>Don Luis</i>, who
was at that Time Gentleman of the Chamber to the King, and afterwards
Prime Minister, and must be understood the Son of his Wife's
Sister, who was a Daughter of <i>Olivarez</i>, married to the <i>Marquis de Valderiabano</i>.</p>

<p>'But Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>, with the other three Ships, sailed from them
within the Islands of <i>Chamilly</i> the 10th <i>May</i> 1640, and having the
Length of Cape <i>Abel</i> on the W. S. W. Side of <i>California</i>, in 26 Degrees
of N. Latitude, 160 Leagues N. W. and W. from the Isles
<i>Chamilly</i>; the Wind sprung up at S. S. E. a steady Gale, that from
the <i>26th</i> of <i>May</i> to the <i>14th</i> of <i>June</i> he had sailed to the River <i>Los
Reys</i>, in 53 Degrees of North Latitude, not having Occasion to lower
a Topsail, in sailing 866 Leagues N. N. W. 410 Leagues from Port
<i>Abel</i> to Cape <i>Blanco</i>, 456 Leagues to <i>Rio los Reyes</i>, all the Time most
pleasant Weather, and sailed about 260 Leagues in crooked Channels,
amongst Islands named the <i>Archipelagus de St. Lazarus</i>; where his
Ships Boats always sailed a Mile a-head, sounding to see what Water,
Rocks, and Sands, there was.'</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> and <i>Pennelossa</i> both put out to Sea together; but as their
Courses were various, one to the Westward of <i>California</i>, and the other
to enter the Gulf. They parted within the Shoals of <i>Chiametla</i> the tenth
of <i>May</i> 1640; and <i>de Fonte</i> attaining the Length of <i>Cape Abel</i> in Latitude
26, one Hundred and sixty Leagues North North-west and West
from the Isles of <i>Chiametla</i>, he then meets with a fair Wind from South
South-east. By the Latitude of Cape <i>Abel</i>, and the Distance run, it is
apparent that the Islands <i>Chiametla</i> mentioned, are the Islands here
meant.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i>, after running one Hundred and sixty Leagues from the Isles
of <i>Chiametla</i>, in Lat. 22 Deg. 10 Min. and Long. 114 Deg. 29 Min.
attaining the Length of Cape <i>Abel</i> in Latitude 26, his Course could not
be North-west and West, but North-west by West westerly, or 61° 22´.
<i>and</i>, instead of, <i>by</i>, may be supposed an Error of the Press.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Heylin</i> mentions a convenient Haven named <i>St. Abad</i>, who wrote
near these Times. But it is <i>Christabel</i>, or <i>Christeval</i>, the Name of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Cape the Extremity of the Land, which forms a Harbour or Port of the
same Name <i>Christabel</i>. <i>Prieto</i> mentions no Place on the main Land but
the three Islands of <i>Casonas</i>, which lie off at Sea, so more to Westward
than this Cape. They are in Lat. 26 Deg. Long. 122 Deg. 24 Min.
the Longitude of Cape <i>Abel</i> I make in 122 Deg. 11 Min. and he lays
down the Point of <i>Madelena</i> in 26 Deg. 30 Min. and the Long. 123
Deg. 24 Min. which seems to be the northermost Land of such Harbour.
By <i>de Fonte</i> mentioning the Latitude of this Cape, and not any
other, he may be supposed to take from hence a new Departure, as was
usual with the <i>Spaniards</i> when they came to this Length in these Seas,
so <i>Prieto</i> mentions <i>Las Bajas de los Abraja, Primier Meridiano</i>. Lat. 25°
15´. Long. 121 Deg. 54 Min. from <i>Lima</i>.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> in his Run from <i>Chiametla</i> met with contrary Winds; but
when the Length of Cape <i>Abel</i>, he had Wind and Weather rather unexpected
in those Parts; and the Spring not being much advanced, he
rather expected to have been, at Times, under his Courses, which is
meant by the Expression afterwards used, that he never had occasion to
lower a Topsail, and is conformable with its being a steady Gale, or did
not overblow. As the Run to <i>Los Reys</i> terminated the fourteenth of
<i>June</i>, <i>de Fonte</i>, for the whole eight Hundred and sixty Leagues, sailed
after the Rate of forty-five Leagues in twenty-four Hours, which is
consistent with and agreeable to the Seamens common Experience,
when favoured with such Wind and Weather. Amongst the Islands
would have the Assistance of the Floods, and Wind enough to stem the
Ebbs.</p>

<p>The Computation of the eight Hundred and sixty-six Leagues is four
Hundred and ten Leagues to Cape <i>Blanquial</i>, to which there is a Course
assigned North North-west; and as to four Hundred and fifty-six
Leagues to <i>Rio los Reys</i>, no Courses are added, which we may assign to
the Courses being originally in the Margin, when one was introduced into
the Copy the other was neglected. And we have just Reason to suspect
the Carelessness here, as it is first called <i>Cape Abel</i>, then <i>Port Abel</i>, and
the River <i>Los Reys</i> in 53 Degrees, and afterwards <i>Rio los Reys</i>, as tho'
they were distinct and separate. With the N. N. W. Course <i>Rio los Reys</i>
could not be in the Latitude <i>de Fonte</i> mentions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p><i>Port Abel</i>, Latitude 26, Long. 122° 11´, and the <i>Callao</i> of <i>Lima</i>, being
laid down Longitude 60 West from the first Meridian of <i>Fero</i>, and
hitherto we have carried on our Computation of Longitude 80 from <i>Paris</i>,
we shall hereafter compute from <i>Fero</i> and <i>London</i>; and Cape <i>Christabel</i>
we compute 102° 11´ from the Meridian of <i>Fero</i>, or 119° 46´ from the
Meridian of <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>The Course four Hundred and ten Leagues North North-west, <i>de
Fonte</i> made Cape <i>Blanquial</i> in Latitude 45, Longitude from <i>London</i>
129° 28´, from the Meridian of <i>Fero</i> 111° 53´, to Northward and Westward
of the Entrance of <i>Martin Aquilar</i>. Sufficient Observations have
not been made to determine by the Geographers as to the true Latitudes
and Longitudes of these Places, and, until they attain more perfect
Informations, must disagree.</p>

<p>The Course from <i>Blanquial</i> is not inserted, but is to be determined by
the Distance two Hundred and sixty Leagues, ending in Latitude 53 at
<i>Rio los Reys</i>. <i>De Fonte</i> had, during the whole Time between <i>Abel</i> and
<i>Los Reys</i>, the Wind in his Favour. Therefore his Course must have
been to the Northward of the East; and if he run two Hundred and
sixty Leagues, with a Course East 52° North, he would make 2 Deg.
1 Min. Latitude, and 20 Deg. 24 Min. Longitude. To correspond with
which <i>de Fonte</i> must, for the one Hundred and ninety-six Leagues,
made his Course North 52 Deg. West, which would determine in Latitude
50 Deg. 59 Min. and in Long. 141 Deg. 12 Min. from <i>London</i>, in
123 Deg. 27 Min. West from <i>Fero</i>. <i>De Fonte</i> would then be about
thirty Leagues from the Land, agreeable to the <i>Russian</i> Discoveries, tho'
this Voyage was made so many Years before that Attempt; a great
Evidence of the Authenticity of this Account. His Conduct also in
this Case was necessary, consistent with the Character of a good Seaman,
not to make the Coast direct, or immediately engage with this <i>Archipelago</i>,
to which he was a Stranger, and in Parts unknown, or where he
had no sailing Directions but to form such Course as gradually to fall in
with the Land, and, as the Wind was, if he saw Occasion, could at any
Time stand off.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> by this Course, agreeable to the Latitude of the <i>Suesta del
Estrech D'Anian</i>, which is laid down by <i>Prieto</i> in Latitude 51, would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
to the Southern Part of the Entrance into such <i>Archipelago</i>, had he been
Northward, as the Wind was, he would have regained it with great
Difficulty and Loss of Time.</p>

<p>As this Table of <i>Prieto</i> was composed before the <i>Russian</i> Discoveries,
and this Land, the <i>Suesta del Estrech D'Anian</i>, is computed in Longitude
141 Deg. 47 Min. computing <i>Lima</i> at 80 Deg. answerable to 238
Deg. 13 Min. East Longitude from <i>Fero</i>, it is a little singular that these
Accounts should agree so well, as to the Longitude of this Part of
<i>America</i>; is an Instance that <i>Prieto</i> did not proceed upon vague Calculations;
had acquired a more exact Account than could be even supposed
in these unfrequented Parts, and in his Care and Exactness, as to the
more known Parts, we have no Reason to doubt but he hath laid down
the Latitude and Longitude of the <i>Suesta del Estrech de Anian</i>, with the
greatest Certainty that he could attain to.</p>

<p>I shall not controvert it whether these are the proper Streights of
<i>Anian</i>. This Entrance was commonly called amongst the Navigators
into those Parts by that Name, as is evident from former Accounts;
and <i>Hornius</i>, from his Maps, which may be seen in <i>Purchase</i>, lays it
down in the same Manner. My Intention is answered in producing an
Authority from the <i>Spaniards</i> of <i>New Spain</i>, that there is an Entrance
here agreeable to the Account in this Letter; also, in all Appearance,
a superior Entrance to that of <i>Martin Aguilar</i>, which <i>Prieto</i> doth not
expresly mention; neither could he properly; but inserts Cape <i>Escondido</i>
in Lat. 43, and Cape <i>Blanquial</i> in Lat. 45, an intermediate Distance of
one Hundred and twenty Miles. Again mentions the Port of <i>Salagua</i>
in Lat. 46, and then the Port of <i>Salado</i> in Lat. 48; in which Interspace
the Entrance of <i>de Fuca</i> is supposed to be.</p>

<p>By the Name <i>Archipelago</i>, <i>de Fonte</i>, who would give the Name with
Propriety, expresses it to be a Sea; and on his Return says, he sailed
down the River <i>Los Reys</i> to the North-east <i>Part</i> of the <i>South Sea</i>; after
that returned home. Where the Word <i>Part</i>, properly speaking, or to use
the Word as it really imports, can be no otherwise understood than as
an Arm or Branch of the <i>South Sea</i>. Had he steered eight Hundred
and sixty-six Leagues North North-west, he must necessarily have traversed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the Courses of those brave Discoverers Capt. <i>Beering</i> and <i>Tschirikow</i>,
which were from Lat. 45 in <i>Asia</i>, to Lat. 56 and 58 in <i>America</i>,
and who were not interrupted by any such Islands. Capt. <i>Tschirikow</i>
positively says, the Coast was without Islands where he was in Lat. 56;
by Capt. <i>Beering</i>'s Account in Lat. 58, the Islands lay only <i>along</i> the
Coast; and <i>de Fonte</i> in his Account mentions, that he sailed in crooked
Channels, amongst Islands. These various Descriptions shew that these
Accounts relate to various Parts. As <i>de Fonte</i> could not, in the whole
Extent between <i>Asia</i> and <i>America</i>, meet with such Islands, and yet was
under a Necessity to pass up crooked Channels, with no small Hazard,
as the Boats being a-head express, his Course must have been to the
Eastward of where Captain <i>Tschirikow</i> fell in with the Land, and for
the Distance of the two Hundred and thirty Leagues before <i>de Fonte</i>
came to a River, to <i>Los Reyes</i>, was then passing up the North-east Part
of the <i>South Sea</i>, as he terms it, and in some Part of which there were
Islands, which he names the <i>Archipelagus of St. Lazarus</i>. There is
a Singularity of Expression in the Letter, <i>where</i> his Boats always sailed
a-head, the Word <i>where</i> limits the Islands to a certain Space, and that
they were not extended the whole two Hundred and thirty Leagues,
which is consistent with the Expedition he made, as otherwise the Ships
must have often shortened sail, and it could not be avoided, and must
have frequently brought up at Night.</p>

<p>As <i>de Fonte</i> did neither make the South or North Shore of this Streight,
the most comprehensive Way of expressing himself was to say, he passed
up these Islands, by which those who had composed his Instructions well
knew the Parts he meant. It must be considered <i>de Fonte</i> was not as
to this Part on Discovery, the Whole would be pointed out to him by
his Instructions, which being to fall in with the Islands, or Entrance in
such a Latitude, to mention either the North or South Limit of the Entrance
would be improper; whereas the contrary was the Case as to
Cape <i>St. Helena</i>, <i>Francisco</i>, <i>Passao</i>, and Cape <i>Abel</i>, as his Instructions
were express, as to the making these Lands.</p>

<p>As <i>de Fonte</i> made a true Course East 81° North, subtract the Longitude
20 Deg. 24 Min. from the Longitude 141 Deg. 12 Min. from <i>London</i>,
and from the 123 Deg. 27 Min. from <i>Fero</i>. The Entrance to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
River _Los Reys_ lies in Lat. 53 Deg. Long. 120 Deg. 48 Min. from _London_,
and 103 Deg. 3 Min. West from <i>Fero</i>. And that his Course was
now Easterly is plain from the subsequent Words of the Letter, <i>as they
sailed more Easterly</i>. It was also confident with the Purpose they were
sent on, to meet a Vessel from <i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p>'The 22d of <i>June</i> Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> dispatched one of his Captains
to <i>Pedro de Barnarda</i>, to sail up a fair River, a gentle Stream, and
deep Water, went first N. and N. E. N. and N. W. into a large Lake
full of Islands, and one very large <i>Peninsula</i> full of Inhabitants, a
friendly honest People in this Lake, he named Lake <i>Valasco</i>, where
Captain <i>Barnarda</i> left his Ship; nor all up the River was less than
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 Fathom Water, both the Rivers and Lakes abounding
with Salmon Trouts, and very large white Perch, some of two
Foot long; and with three large <i>Indian</i> Boats, by them called <i>Periagos</i>,
made of two large Trees 50 or 60 Foot long. Capt. <i>Barnarda</i> first
sailed from his Ships in the Lake <i>Valasco</i>, one Hundred and forty
Leagues West, and then 436 E. N. E. to 77 Degrees of Latitude.

of the North and East Part of the <i>Tartarian Sea</i>.'</p>

<p>We may suppose, from the Manner in which this Part was managed,
that there was a great Necessity to get the Translation finished in any
Manner. As the Difficulties of the Translation increased, the Design of
this Account being only Amusement, the Translator thought it would
answer the Purpose to give the Account in gross.</p>

<p>The Date, the 22d <i>June</i>, is an apparent Error, by reason <i>de Fonte</i>
did not enter into Lake <i>Belle</i>, as will be shewn hereafter, until that
Time.</p>

<p>Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> dispatched one of his Captains to <i>Pedro de Barnarda</i>,
to sail up a fair River, gentle Stream, and deep Water. Then the Translation
breaks off abruptly, and the Translator renders the following
Part as an Account of <i>Bernarda</i>'s Voyage, not observing how just a
Connection there is with <i>de Fonte</i> dispatching one of his Captains to <i>Bernarda</i>;
and what follows being the Orders sent by him, and the Instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
for <i>Bernarda</i>; instead of being <i>Bernarda</i>'s Account of his Expedition,
and not observing how consistent it is with being a summary
Recital of those Instructions these Words are which follow, Admiral <i>de
Fonte</i>, after he had dispatched Captain <i>Bernarda</i> on the Discovery, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>As to his dispatching one of his Captains, he must be supposed to
have besides the Captain of the Ship he was in, also one called an Admiral's
Captain. The Instructions were of such Consequence, that a less
Person might not be so properly employed, nor consistent with the Respect
due to <i>Bernarda</i>.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> and <i>Bernarda</i> were Strangers here; but these Parts had been
already discovered, as it is expresly said that <i>two Pater Jesuits</i> had been
here two Years, and made Observations as far as the Latitude 66.
From their Discoveries we may conclude, that these Instructions were
formed which <i>Bernarda</i> received, and those of the whole Course of the
Voyage; and it was necessary that <i>de Fonte</i> should not only mention that
he had dispatched <i>Bernarda</i>, but should also, with the Brevity due to a
Letter, mention the Orders with which he dispatched him. And further
from what is expressed in those Orders, as to the River, the Course
and Soundings, what Fish were in the River and Lake, the Road or
Harbour which was to be found in the Lake, the Temper and Disposition
of the Inhabitants, it evidently appears that there had been a prior
Discovery of these Parts, and Observations made of every Thing worthy
of Consideration, and necessary also at this Time to be mentioned to
<i>Bernarda</i>. To let him know that his Ship could pass up the River,
would find a Harbour in the Lake, he had nothing to fear from the
Natives, and would meet with Provisions. There leaving his Ship he
might be furnished with <i>Periagos</i> to proceed. And I understand his Directions
to steer first North and North-east, then North and North-west,
that he might make no Mistake by pursuing or entering into any other
Openings which might present themselves in his Course up, and which
from their Appearance might perplex him, as to which of them he was
to enter; no uncommon Thing, as those who have been to Northward
on like Undertakings will allow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>'The Admiral sailed up a very navigable River, which he named
<i>Rio los Reys</i>, that run nearest N. E. but on several Points of the Compass
60 Leagues, at low Water, in a fair navigable Channel, not less
than 4 or 5 Fathom Water. It flowed on both Rivers near the same
Water, in the River <i>Los Reys</i>, 24 Feet Full and Change of the Moon;
a S. S. E. Moon made high Water. It flowed in the River <i>Haro</i>, 22
Feet and a half Full and Change. They had two Jesuits with them,
that had been on their Mission to 66 Degrees of North Latitude, and
had made curious Observations.'</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i>, having dispatched <i>Bernarda</i>, sets out on his Part of the Expedition,
and proceeds up the River <i>Los Reys</i>, at the Entrance of which
he had arrived the fourteenth of <i>June</i>. During his Stay, until <i>Bernarda</i>
was dispatched and sailed, he seems to have taken an accurate Account
of the Tides in both Rivers. The Distance up the River was more than
sixty Leagues, and though a good navigable Channel, yet would require
a great Precaution in his Proceeding with the two Ships; Tide
Times and the Night would make it necessary for him to bring too; for
had he touched the Ground with either of them, the Delay that might
have followed on such Accident, might have defeated this Part of the
Undertaking, and the most important, and which, therefore, was allotted
to him to execute.</p>

<p>Their having had two Jesuits with them seems an additional Note.
That two Jesuits should be sent into those Parts to make Observations,
is but consistent with the general Practice of the Jesuits to go on Missions
into all Parts of the Globe, engaged by a special Vow, not injoined
any other Order, to be always ready to go and preach whithersoever they
shall be sent.</p>

<p>These Jesuits are by no Means a singular Instance of the People of that
Order being great Adventurers, when we consider those who ventured to
the <i>Philippinas</i> and <i>Japan</i>, enforced by the Vow, puffed up with the Vanity
of popular Applause, the Favour of the President, and the Hope of
being acceptable to the rest of the Order on their return from such Mission,
expecting by such Mission to add to the Wealth or Reputation of the
Order. The Effect of this Mission seems to have been they had acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the Favour of the Natives. Had made some Observations of the
Country, but principally to Northward, as to which they seem not to
have got a perfect Account; though they did a great deal for the Time,
the Unseasonableness of the Winter, and the melting Weather in the
Spring considered; nor is it strange they should not get a perfect Account,
in a Country so intermixed with Waters, which hide themselves in
their Courses between inaccessible Mountains; and in many Places where
they are to be come at, are deceitful in their Appearance, as to what they
really are, whether Lakes, Gulphs of the Sea, or Inlets. As they proceeded
to the Northward, they thought it the Part that principally claimed their
Observation. Were of Opinion as to the Northward, that it was Part of
the Continent of <i>New Spain</i>, or they would not have lead <i>de Fonte</i> to <i>Los
Reys</i>, but caused him to proceed up that Streight which separated the
Part they had been in from <i>New Spain</i>. As to this Mission not being
known to the Publick, these Jesuits must have been sent from <i>Europe</i>
into <i>New Spain</i>; and they would so far regard their Obedience to the
Pope, as to pay due Respect to the King of <i>Spain</i>'s Authority, in observing
the established Maxim of the Time, as to keep their Discoveries
a Secret from the Publick or other Nations. And as to all Missionaries
who went into <i>New Spain</i>, the King of <i>Spain</i> hath a Power to call
them to Account, by the Pope's Permission, though not permitted in
<i>Old Spain</i> to meddle with ecclesiastical Affairs, or ecclesiastical Men.</p>

<p>'A Letter from Captain <i>Barnarda</i>, dated the 27th of <i>June</i> 1740, that
he had left his Ship in the Lake <i>Valasco</i>, betwixt the Islands <i>Barnarda</i>
and the Peninsula <i>Conibasset</i>, a very safe Port; it went down the River
from the Lake 3 Falls, 80 Leagues, and fell into the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea
in 61 Deg. with the Pater Jesuits, and 36 Natives, in three of their
Boats, and 20 of his <i>Spanish</i> Seamen; that the Land trended away
North East; that they should want no Provision, the Country abounding
with Venison of three Sorts, and the Sea and Rivers with excellent
Fish (Bread, Salt, Oil, and Brandy they carried with them) that
he should do what was possible. The Admiral, when he received the
Letter from Captain <i>Barnarda</i>, was arrived at an <i>Indian</i> Town called
<i>Conosset</i>, on the South Side Lake <i>Belle</i>, where the two Pater Jesuits on
their Mission had been two Years; a pleasant Place. The Admiral,
with his two Ships, enter'd the Lake the 22d of <i>June</i>.'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>The Letter from <i>Bernarda</i> being dated the 27th of <i>June</i>, it is impossible
he should finish all that Business in four Days, which he gives <i>de
Fonte</i> an Account of: This also confirms its being a Mistake as to the
22d of <i>June</i>, being the Time he received his Dispatches. It might well
take <i>Bernarda</i> from the fourteenth of <i>June</i> to the twenty-seventh to receive
his Dispatches, to pass up the River, and to the Peninsula in Lake
<i>Valasco</i>, procure the Natives, who were not under his Command, get all
Things fitted, and set out. And what this Letter contains, makes it
evident it could be no Account of his Voyage that was before-mentioned.</p>

<p>This Letter is apparently an Answer to the Dispatches <i>Bernarda</i> received
from <i>de Fonte</i>. He mentions, that he had left his Ship, agreeable
to Orders, and in a safe Port; gives an Account how he was equipped
to proceed; the Number of the Persons he had with him; that he had
thirty-six of the Natives, which is conformable to the Character given
of them, a friendly honest People, and shews the Influence of the Jesuits.
These Natives, by joining in the Expedition, were Hostages for
the good Behaviour of the others towards his People left behind, and
an Assurance to <i>Bernarda</i> for the Security of his Ship left at the Port,
were of great Use as Pilots as to the Coast, and also in sailing and
managing their <i>Periagos</i>. Their having these <i>Periagos</i> implies they had
a Country abounding with Waters; and it was their usual Way of passing
from one Part to another, Time and Experience had made them
expert in the Management of them; and by shifting from one Part to
the other as the Seasons required for hunting or fishing, and by Excursions
out of their own Country either for War or Curiosity, as is the
Nature of <i>Indians</i>, they were become acquainted not only with the inland
Waters, but also the Sea Coasts.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> had ordered Captain <i>Bernarda</i> that he should sail one Hundred
and fifty Leagues West (but is rather to be believed a Mistake
from not understanding the Compass, <i>Oeste</i> and <i>Este</i> being so similar)
and then four Hundred and thirty-six Leagues East North East to 77
Degrees of Latitude. In Answer to which <i>Bernarda</i> here mentions, that
from the Lake <i>Valasco</i> there was a River in which there was three Falls,
eighty Leagues in Distance, and fell into the <i>Tartarian Sea</i>, in Latitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> 61; that the Land trended away North East, and that he would do
what was possible. By which Expression it is plain, that he did not
pursue the exact Course that <i>de Fonte</i> directed; probably that Course
was pointed out to <i>Bernarda</i> by which the Jesuits had travelled to Latitude
66, but pursued a Course more immediate and direct to attain to Latitude
77, the Back of <i>Baffin</i>'s Bay, as to which the Natives had informed
him; and that though he did not pursue the Course directed by <i>de Fonte</i>,
which he found not to be so consistent with the Design he was sent on,
yet he would do all that was possible to answer that Design. And the
Expression also implies, that he was sensible he should meet with Difficulties,
which he might expect from the Climate, the Ice, and the Fatigue;
but as to the Article of Provisions, was in no Fear on that Account.
As to what is mentioned as to Venison of three Sorts, they were
the small Deer, the Moose, and the Elk, all which are in the Northern
Parts about <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, and the <i>Labrador</i> Coast.</p>

<p>The Name of <i>Haro</i> given to the River is a particular Compliment
to <i>Don Haro</i>, who was the Head of the Houses of <i>Valasco</i>; and the
Name of <i>Valasco</i>, in Compliment to the other Houses, of that Family.
Which Respect shewn by <i>de Fonte</i> seems to indicate a particular Connection
with, or his being related to that Family, as already mentioned.
<i>Valasco</i>, as here wrote, with a <i>va</i>, as those Families did write it at that
Time, and one of that Family, who was Constable of <i>Castile</i>, in his Titles
is named <i>John Ferdinandes de Vallasco</i>, Constable of <i>Castilia</i>, &amp;c. now
Lord of the Houses of <i>Vallasco</i>, &amp;c. and by the Orthography in the
Letter being so conformable with that which was used at that Time,
and not with a <i>ve</i> as at present, we have very good Reason to suppose,
that the Letter was not only wrote in <i>Spanish</i>, but also by <i>de Fonte</i> on his
return from his Voyage. Don <i>Ferdinandez</i> was living in 1610, and succeeded
by his Son, in his Title and Honour of Constable of <i>Castile</i>, <i>Don
Bernardino</i>, who was living at the Time of the Voyage.</p>

<p>'The Admiral entered the Lake an Hour before high Water, and
there was no Fall or Cataract, and 4 and 5 Fathom Water, and 6 and
7 Fathom Water generally in the Lake <i>Belle</i>. There is a little Fall
of Water half Flood, and an Hour and Quarter before high Water
the Flood begins to set gently into Lake <i>Belle</i>: The River is fresh at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
20 Leagues Distance from the Mouth or Entrance of the River <i>Los
Reyes</i>. The River and Lake abounds with Salmon, Salmon Trouts,
Pikes, Perch and Mullets, and two other Sorts of Fish peculiar to
that River, admirable good; and Lake <i>Belle</i> also abounds with all
those Sorts of Fish large and delicate: And Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> also says,
the Mullets catched in <i>Rios Reyes</i> and Lake <i>Belle</i>, are much delicater
than are to be found, he believes, in any Part of the World.'</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> was not inactive from the 14th to the 22d of <i>June</i>. Various
Courses, contrary Winds, waiting for the Tides at times; from the Circumstance
of the Tide as to Lake <i>Belle</i>, that there is a Fall until half
Flood, and it is an Hour and Quarter only before high Water that
the Flood makes in, evidences that there was a Current against him;
and it is further evident, as on his return he was but two Days running
from <i>Conosset</i> to the Entrance of the River <i>Los Reyes</i>.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> is very particular in his Account, being now to take a Survey
of the Parts through which a Passage was expected, and in which
Parts he now was. He mentions the Trial of the Tides at <i>Los Reyes</i> and
<i>Haro</i>; gives a particular Account of the Navigation up <i>Los Reyes</i>, and
to Lake <i>Belle</i>; that it was fresh Water after they were sixty Miles up the
River; and what is no immaterial Circumstance in this Affair, shews
how far the Waters from Westward flowed up, which he instances in the
Account of the Fish. That such as came out of the Sea into the Land
or fresh Waters to spawn at those Seasons, and afterwards return to the
Sea, went no further than Lake <i>Belle</i>; for here he found the Mother
Fish, as he describes them, large and delicate, superior to those in the
River, and indulges his Fancy, so delicate as, he believes, they are not
to be exceeded in any other Part of the World. <i>De Fonte</i>, in his Orders
to <i>Bernarda</i>, shewed it was fresh Water in Part of <i>Haro</i>, and in the Lake
<i>Conibasset</i>, from the Salmon and Perch, in which he means Sea Perch,
which come into fresh Waters at this Season of the Year.</p>

<p>'The first of <i>July</i> 1640, Admiral <i>de Fonte</i> sailed from the rest of his
Ships in the Lake <i>Belle</i>, in a good Port, covered by a fine Island, before
the Town of <i>Conosset</i>, from thence to a River I named <i>Parmentiers</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
in Honour of my industrious judicious Comrade Mr. <i>Parmentiers</i>,
who had most exactly marked every Thing in and about that River.'</p>

<p>We now proceed to consider the Remainder of Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>'s
Letter, which was published in <i>June</i> 1708.</p>

<p>Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>, when he received the Letter from Capt. <i>Bernarda</i>,
was arrived at an <i>Indian</i> Town called <i>Conosset</i>, in the Lake <i>Belle</i>; and as
he entered such Lake the twenty-second, probably arrived at the Town
the same Day; staid eight Days, and then sailed the first of <i>July</i>. That
<i>Bernarda</i> should write, as to the Situation of his Affairs, must have
been before concerted between them, they having been informed by
the Jesuits or <i>Parmentiers</i>, that it was practicable for <i>Bernarda</i> to send
such Message, that the Admiral might know whether <i>Bernarda</i> had met
with any Accident as to his Ship, or any other Obstacle to his Proceeding,
as he might assist him from those Ships Companies then with the
Admiral. How the Letter was conveyed is not expressed; probably
by a Seaman with an <i>Indian</i> Guide (the Distance between the Admiral
and <i>Bernarda</i>, at this Time, will be considered hereafter) who would
use all possible Expedition both by Land and Water: Had the Advantage
of very short Nights. <i>De Fonte</i> would not proceed until he received
this Account, though ready as soon as he received it. As <i>de
Fonte</i> sailed on the first of <i>July</i>, that Account must have come to his
Hand the thirtieth of <i>June</i>.</p>

<p>The Ships being secure in a good Harbour, and the Command left
with <i>Ronquillo</i>, the Admiral proceeds to the River <i>Parmentiers</i>, so named
in Honour of Mons. <i>Parmentiers</i>, whom he stiles his Comrade, and
commends his Industry and Judgment in the Survey of such River, and
the Parts adjacent. From his being stiled his Comrade, he was in no
Command, as he could not have a Commission without having been bred
in the Service, and a Native of <i>Spain</i>. Therefore being a Person immediately
necessary for to have on this Occasion, he is introduced under
the Character of a Friend and Companion. Mr. <i>Gage</i> mentions, Chap.
xv. of his new Survey of the <i>West Indies</i>, one <i>Thomas Rocalono</i>, a <i>Frenchman</i>,
a Prior of the Cloister of <i>Cemitlan</i>, who, with himself, was the only
Stranger in that Country, by which he means in that Part where he was;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and it implies there being others in other Parts, which falsifies the Assertion
that no <i>Frenchman</i> was ever admitted in <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p>The Countries of <i>Quivira</i> and <i>Anian</i> were represented, at that Time,
to be barren or desolate; as is also evident from the Description of the
Inhabitants eating raw Flesh, drinking Blood, and in all Respects suitable
to the Character of the <i>Eskemaux Indians</i>, who by Choice, not Necessity,
make Use of such Diet when out a hunting or travelling, which
expresses those Parts to be very inhospitable, and where the <i>Indians</i> only
frequent at certain Seasons, in Pursuit of the wild Game, and for fishing.
And <i>Cibola</i> is represented as a Country which hath a Cultivation, where
the <i>Indians</i> constantly live, and seem a different People from those of
<i>Quivira</i> and <i>Anian</i>. This is agreeable to the Accounts given at that
Time, which is sufficient to shew that the Jesuits could not expect that
they should be able, or would undertake to pass through such a Country
as <i>Quivira</i> and <i>Anian</i> in Pursuit of their Discoveries to Northward;
therefore must have taken some Opportunity of being conveyed there,
which could only be by some Persons who had been on these Coasts,
and had, through Necessity, Interest, or Curiosity, passed up these Waters,
and surveyed the adjacent Country in Pursuit of something which
might turn out to their private Emolument: Nor were such Attempts
unprecedented, even on our Parts, though the Hazards were much
greater. The private Trade carried on by the People from <i>Boston</i>, in
<i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, before there was a Grant to the Company; which Trading
might not have come to the Knowledge of the People in <i>England</i>, or
been known to the Publick for a Series of Years, had it not been for
an Accident which happened to Captain <i>Gillam</i>, who thereupon made a
Discovery of this Trade. Nor is there the least Improbability but that
<i>Parmentiers</i> had, on some Occasion, introduced himself into these Parts,
had invited the Jesuits to a Mission there, who, on other Missions, had
undertaken what hath been much more hazardous, and succeeded. There
were sufficient Motives for that Undertaking; the Northern Bounds were
then unknown, so that they could not affirm <i>America</i> to be Continent,
nor certainly to be an Island distinguished from the old World. This is
the Account Mr. <i>Gage</i> gives us, Chap. xiii. and mentioning that he will
not write, as many do, by Relation and Hearsay, but by more sure Intelligence,
Insight and Experience. He says <i>Quivira</i> is seated on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
most Western Part of <i>America</i>, just over against <i>Tartary</i>; from whence,
being not much distant, some suppose that the Inhabitants came into this
new World. The West Side of <i>America</i>, if it be not Continent with
<i>Tartary</i>, it yet disjoined by a small Streight. Here then was a sufficient
Matter to encourage a Mission of this Sort, and to keep a Progress to
the Eastward, or in <i>America</i>, with the Discoveries that were going on by
the Missionars sent to <i>Japan</i>; and there was a Propriety in this being
done, as the Coasts of both were supposed to be at no great Distance
from each other: And this was expresly the Purpose of their Mission,
as it is said they had been to Latitude 66, and made curious Observations,
on which Account they were with <i>Bernarda</i>. As <i>Parmentiers</i>
went to the Eastward with <i>de Fonte</i>, who must have had a different Motive
from them for coming into those Parts, he must have had his own
private Emolument in view, his better Success in which depended on
his Secrecy, as he thereby prevented others from interfering; which
Consideration would prevail with him, as with all Traders, superior to
any Satisfaction the Publick might have from his Informations; and as
Trade would be carried on most successfully where the Inhabitants were
more numerous, we find he had found his Way to Eastward, apparently
the most populous, as the Jesuits had gone to the Northward and Westward,
principally as most consistent with their Plan; tho' <i>Conosset</i> was
where the Jesuits had been first introduced, where their courteous Behaviour
and Management of the Natives, would be of Advantage to <i>Parmentiers</i>.
In searching for the most popular and inhabited Part of the
Country, he would become acquainted with the Geography of those
Parts necessarily, Depths of Water, Shoals, Tides, which his own Preservation,
and the better conducting of himself would naturally lead him
to observe; but there might be a more particular Reason for his Observation
of the River <i>Parmentiers</i>, and of all the Parts about it; and
therefore he had been so exact as to the Falls, which were the Obstruction
of the Ship Navigation through to the Eastern Sea, that lay beyond
the Streights of <i>Ronquillo</i>, for his own private Advantage; by opening
a new and extensive Trade, he would have greatly promoted it if he had
found this Communication practicable for Ships of Burthen.</p>

<p>The People that Captain <i>Tchirikow</i> met with on the Coast is no Objection
to the Character given of those within Land in this Letter, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
is from Experience known that the <i>Eskemaux</i>, who are along the Coast
of the <i>Labrador</i>, are cruel and thievish; but that <i>Indians</i> of a different
Disposition live within Land.</p>

<p>As to <i>Parmentiers</i> being the general Interpreter for all, he is not said
to be so. He would, for the Benefit it would be to him in his Trade,
endeavour to learn the Language, and would of course acquire something
of it unavoidably, as he frequented amongst the <i>Indians</i>: And it
must be observed, though there are many different Nations, and there
is a Difference in Dialect, yet there is a Language which all those Nations
will understand, called the Council Language.</p>

<p>That Voyages had been made to these Parts more than once is evident,
as the Jesuits staid there two Years, therefore did not return with
the same Opportunity by which they came there, but another; and it
is probable that there had been a Voyage prior to that, which had encouraged
them to undertake this Mission.</p>

<p>In what Manner <i>de Fonte</i> proceeded, the Boats and Number of Persons
he had with him, the Translator hath omitted. It is mentioned,
that <i>de Fonte</i> sailed from the rest of his Ships; the River <i>Parmentiers</i>
hath Falls of thirty-two Feet perpendicular Height from its Source to
where it issues into Lake <i>de Fonte</i>; so again, on the South Side Lake
<i>Belle</i> on board our Ships; and had it been with his Ship, his Inference
that there was no North-west Passage would have been unjust, as his
meeting with this Ship the Vessel from <i>Boston</i>, would have effectually
proved the contrary.</p>

<p>'We passed eight Falls, in all 32 Foot, perpendicular from its Source
out of Lake <i>Belle</i>; it falls into the large Lake I named Lake <i>de Fonte</i>,
at which Place we arrived the 6th of <i>July</i>. This Lake is 160 Leagues
long, and 60 broad; the Length is East North East, and West South
West, to twenty or thirty, in some Places sixty Fathom deep; the
Lake abounds with excellent Cod and Ling, very large and well fed;
there are several very large Islands, and ten small ones; they are covered
with shrubby Woods; the Moss grows six or seven Foot long,
with which the Moose, a very large Sort of Deer, are fat with in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Winter, and other lesser Deer, as Fallow, <i>&amp;c.</i> There are Abundance
of wild Cherries, Strawberries, Hurtleberries, and wild Currants; and
also of wild Fowls, Heath Cocks and Hens; likewise Partridges and
Turkeys; and Sea Fowl in great Plenty. On the South Side the Lake
is a very large fruitful Island, had a great many Inhabitants, and
very excellent Timber, as Oaks, Ashes, Elm and Fir Trees, very
large and tall.'</p>

<p>We here again see the Form of the Letter, <i>de Fonte</i> expressing himself,
as in the first Part of the Letter, <i>I named Parmentiers</i>, <i>my industrious</i>;
and there are other Instances.</p>

<p>The River <i>Parmentiers</i>, which is the Communication by which the
Waters of Lake <i>Belle</i> are conveyed into the Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, so named
we may suppose not in Compliment to himself, which would be absurd,
but of his Family, as the Expression is, <i>I named Lake de Fonte</i>, though
it almost deserves the Name of a Mediterranean Sea; but from having
a superior Water near it, with which it communicated, <i>de Fonte</i> calls
it a Lake. It is not a casual naming of Places, or Waters, as <i>Hudson</i>'s
Bay, given to that great Mediterranean Sea, and continued, but the
Names of the Waters he passed through, would be given with Exactness
and Propriety. In the Lake <i>de Fonte</i> there was a great Depth of
Water, also Banks, as there is said to be in some Parts twenty or thirty
Fathom Water, as is also evident from the Cod and Ling there, and
which instance it to be a Salt Water Lake. It was the Season when these
Fish come to the Northward to spawn. The shrubby Wood on the
Islands, the Moss for the Subsistence of the Deer hanging on the Trees,
the wild Cherries and other Fruits ripening at that Season of the Year,
are all corresponding Tokens of his being advanced to the North-east
Part of <i>America</i>, is agreeable in all the above Respects to the Country
Northward and Westward in <i>Canada</i>, about the River <i>St. Lawrence</i>, to
the interior Parts of the Country of <i>Labrador</i>, in Lat. 56; but as you
proceed further to Northward, the high rocky Mountains, which in
this Part are only confined to the Coast, then extend more inland, increase
in their Height, and in Lat. 59° and 60°, the whole Country, as far as
<i>Baffin</i>'s Bay, seems to consist only of Ridges of barren Mountains, interspersed
with Waters; and the Progress of the Productions, as to Trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and Plants, gradually decreases from a more flourishing to an inferior
Sort, as you proceed to Northward; in Lat. 59, on the Western Side of
<i>Hudson</i>'s Bay to the Northward of <i>Seal</i> River, there is no Wood, only
Grass and a small Shrub of about a Foot in Heighth, which continues,
as far as it is known to Westward, and a thin Soil, with a hard rocky
Stone just below the Surface, and very frequently there are large Ponds
of standing Water.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> seems to have made a Stop at the Island at the South of
Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, to take Refreshment, and make Inquiry as to the <i>Boston</i>
Ship, it being out of his Course, or on any other Account to go there.</p>

<p>'The 14th of <i>July</i> we sailed out of the East North-east End of the
Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, and passed a Lake I named the <i>Estricho de Ronquillo</i>,
thirty-four Leagues long, two or three Leagues broad, twenty, twenty-six
and twenty-eight Fathom of Water; we passed this Streight in ten
Hours, having a stout Gale of Wind, and a whole Ebb. As we sailed
more Easterly the Country grew very sensibly worse.'</p>

<p>What follows, 'as it is in the North and South Parts of <i>America</i>,' appears
to me an additional Comment.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> mentions, as he went more Easterly the Country grew worse;
from which it may be supposed he found the Alteration to begin when
he was come to the Eastern Part of the Lake, and more so, as he passed
the Streights of <i>Ronquillo</i>.</p>

<p>Where the Streight of <i>Ronquillo</i> terminated <i>de Fonte</i> makes no mention;
gives us no Account of the Soundings or Tides; but his Silence
here, and the preceding Circumstances, sufficiently prove that he thought
himself then in some Branch of the <i>Atlantick Ocean</i>. And it is to be observed
there is the same affected Silence here as to the Part he was
come into, as when he had left the Western Ocean and entered the
North-east Part of the <i>South Sea</i> to pass up to <i>Los Reys</i>.</p>

<p>'The 17th we came to an <i>Indian</i> Town, and the <i>Indians</i> told our Interpreter
Mons. <i>Parmentiers</i>, that a little Way from us lay a great Ship,
where there never had been one before.'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>The <i>Indian</i> telling the Interpreter <i>Parmentiers</i>, which expresses a Kind
of Acquaintance made between them, and <i>de Fonte</i>'s passing out of the
Lake into the Sea, coming to a Town, and <i>Parmentiers</i> knowing the
Language, is an Evidence of <i>Parmentiers</i>' having been there before.
And we may suppose, that from the Time they left the River <i>Parmentiers</i>,
<i>de Fonte</i> had been on the Inquiry, it being now Time to expect the
People from <i>Boston</i>; and what the <i>Indian</i> told him was in pursuance of
such Inquiry.</p>

<p>'We sailed to them, and found only one Man advanced in Years,
and a Youth; the Man was the greatest Man in the Mechanical Parts
of the Mathematicks, I had ever met with; my second Mate was an
<i>Englishman</i>, an excellent Seaman, as was my Gunner, who had been
taken Prisoners at <i>Campechy</i>, as well as the Master's Son; they told me
the Ship was of <i>New England</i>, from a Town called <i>Boston</i>. The Owner
and the whole Ship's Company came on board the thirtieth; and the
Navigator of the Ship, Captain <i>Shapley</i>, told me, his Owner was a fine
Gentleman, and <i>Major General</i> of the largest Colony in <i>New England</i>,
called the <i>Maltechusets</i>; so I received him like a Gentleman, and told
him my Commission was to make a Prize of any People seeking a
North-west or West Passage into the <i>South Sea</i>; but I would look on
them as Merchants trading with the Natives for Bevers, Otters and
other Furs and Skins, and so for a small Present of Provisions I had
no need on, I gave him my Diamond Ring, which cost me twelve
Hundred Pieces of Eight (which the modest Gentleman received with
difficulty) and having given the brave Navigator <i>Captain Shapley</i>, for
his fine Charts and Journals, a Thousand Pieces of Eight, and the
Owner of the Ship, <i>Seimor Gibbons</i>, a quarter Cask of good <i>Peruan</i>
Wine, and the ten Seamen, each twenty Pieces of Eight, the sixth of
<i>August</i>, with as much Wind as we could fly before and a Current, we
arrived at the first Fall of the River <i>Parmentiers</i>.'</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> makes no Delay, but immediately proceeds as the Case required;
finds an old Man aboard, the Man (as being a great Mechanick
might be very useful on such an Expedition) and a Youth, might
venture to stay, their Age would plead as to any Severity that might be
intended by <i>de Fonte</i>; and through the Fear of which Severity the others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
retired into the Woods, where they could manage without being sensible
of those Difficulties which <i>Europeans</i> apprehend. To leave the Ship
without any one aboard, <i>de Fonte</i> could of Course have taken her as
being deserted; and by their Retirement into the Woods, his Pursuit of
them there would have alarmed the <i>Indians</i>, and more especially if he
had attempted any Severity, it might have been fatal to him and his
Company, from the Resistance they might have met with, not only from
the <i>Boston</i> People, but the <i>Indians</i> assisting them, as they would have
considered it as an Insult, an Exercise of Power which they would apprehend
he had no Right to use in those Parts, as to a People who were
trading with them, and been the Occasion that the <i>Spaniards</i> would have
been no more received as Friends in those Parts.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> had particularly provided himself with some <i>Englishmen</i>, who,
by a friendly Converse with the People from <i>Boston</i>, might endeavour to
learn their Secrets, and prepare them the better by what they would be
instructed to tell them to come to a Compliance with the Admiral's Intentions.
The Result of this Affair <i>de Fonte</i> only mentions; but they
would not have staid away so long, would have returned sooner aboard,
had they only left the Ship on Account of Trade. Trade was only a secondary
Object, the Discovery was the principal, and they would not
have staid in one Place, at this Season, had they not been necessitated
through a Fear of <i>de Fonte</i> so to do. It may be supposed the <i>Englishmen</i>
who were with <i>de Fonte</i>, two of whom were from <i>Campechy</i>, and the
other become Catholick, as he was married to the Master's Daughter,
they would not act either with much Sincerity or Truth as to their own
Countrymen, but managed with the old Man to bring the Owner, Navigator,
and rest of the Crew aboard.</p>

<p>On their return the Navigator of the Ship was the first who waited on
the Admiral, and he calls him Captain <i>Shapley</i>, his Name <i>Nicholas Shapley</i>,
who was famous as a Navigator, for his Knowledge in the Mathematicks
and other Branches of Science, that the common People supposed
he dealt in the Magick Art, and had the Name given him of
<i>Old Nick</i>, not by the People of <i>Boston</i>, but by a Set of Libertines as
they termed them, and who had separated from the People of <i>Boston</i>,
and gone to live by themselves at <i>Piscatua</i>, where he was settled at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Place called <i>Kittery</i>, in the Province of <i>Main</i>; the Name of <i>Kittery</i>
given by his Brother <i>Alexander Shapley</i>, to a Tract of Land he had settled
on there; and they write the Name <i>Shapley</i> exactly in the Manner in which
it is wrote in the Letter. The Brother <i>Alexander</i> was a Cotemporary at
<i>Oxford</i> with Captain <i>James</i>, who went on Discovery, and his Acquaintance.
The Descendants of <i>Alexander</i>, a genteel People, were not many
Years since living at <i>Kittery</i>; but <i>Nicholas Shapley</i> retired to <i>New London</i>,
where he had a Son that was living in the Year one Thousand seven Hundred
and fifty-two, a Fisherman. The Family at <i>Kittery</i> were very shy
as to giving any Information as to what they knew in this Affair, upon
an Application by the Author of these Observations, or looking into
<i>Alexander</i>'s Papers, as an officious Person had got beforehand, and discouraged
them from giving any Gratification of this Sort, under Pretence,
if their Papers were seen, it might give some Insight into a Lawsuit
depending between the Branches of the Family, or expected to be
commenced; and that there was a great Reward for the Discovery of a
North-west Passage, which, if the Account was attained from them
they would be intitled to a Part, which by this Means they would be
deprived of. Jealousies of this Kind raised by a pretended, at least an
ignorant Friend, against the Application of a Stranger, who assured
them he was superior to any Trick of that Sort, and would give them
any Satisfaction in his Power as they should propose, occasioned a Disappointment.
The Son of Captain <i>Nicholas</i>, upon an Application made
by the Author likewise, had nothing but his Father's Sea Chest, in which,
there were once a great many Papers, and which his Mother, the Wife
of Captain <i>Nicholas</i>, made a great Account of; but the Son being an
illiterate Man, had made Use of them in the Family as waste Paper. I
have mentioned him as illiterate, but he was a well meaning Man, and he
had heard his Mother talk something about such an Affair; but I shall not
lay a Stress upon the Account he gave, as he may be supposed prompted
by the earnest Manner of the Inquiry to give grateful Answers, in Expectation
of a Reward. The Number of Settlers in all <i>Piscatua</i>, the Province of
<i>Main</i> included, did not at that Time exceed four Hundred People, but is
now become a well settled Country; yet there was amongst the antient
People about <i>Kittery</i>, a Tradition of Captain <i>Nicholas</i> having been on
such a Voyage, and as to which, on proper Application to Persons who
have Influence, and will make due Inquiry, it appears to me the Publick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
will receive a farther Satisfaction than they may at present expect. A
considerable Merchant who lived at <i>Falmouth</i> in <i>Piscatua</i>, a Man of
Character, no Way biassed for or against a North-west Passage, but as
he is since dead, I may take the Liberty to say, married a Daughter of
his late Excellency Governor <i>Weymouth</i>, mentioned an Anecdote respecting
his Father, who was a very antient Man: That when the Dispute
was between the late Governor <i>Dobbs</i> and Captain <i>Middleton</i>, he
said, Why do they make such a Fuzz about this Affair, our <i>Old Nick</i>
(meaning Captain <i>Shapley</i>) was through there? And this antient Gentleman
had been an Intimate of Captain <i>Shapley</i>'s.</p>

<p>Early in the Year before this Voyage Major General <i>Gibbons</i> went
with others over to <i>Piscatua</i>, to have a Conference about Church Matters;
and Mr. <i>Alexander Shapley</i> was one on the Part of the Settlers in
<i>Piscatua</i>, and who had but returned from <i>England</i> the Fall before. At
this Meeting, probably, they fixed on the Time and Manner of executing
the Design, which they had before concerted. This whole Affair was
concerted in an obscure Part, the Affair not known to the People of <i>Boston</i>,
as it was more to the Purpose of those who undertook it to keep it a Secret;
and probably Major <i>Gibbons</i> was more inclined it should be so, as
he had before met with two Disappointments. The Characters of the
Persons were such, as by whom it is very reasonable to suppose such an
Expedition might be undertaken. Mr. <i>Alexander Shapley</i> was a Merchant,
a lively, active, enterprising Man; sufficient to this Purpose hath
been said of his Brother: And we may add to the Character of Major
General <i>Gibbons</i>, it was said of him, that he was much of a Gentleman,
a brave, social and friendly Man, had the latter End of the Year 1639
a Commission to be Captain of the Fort, was one of the Council, also
concerned in Church Matters, as appears from Records. But during
the Time that this Voyage was making, that worthy Pastor of <i>Boston</i>
and great Antiquarian Mr. <i>Prince</i>, who, from a generous Disposition to
get at the Truth, used extraordinary Industry in this Affair, by searching
the Records in the old Church there in the Year 1752, could not find
his Hand set to any Thing, or any Matters relating to Major General
<i>Gibbons</i>, tho' he found Papers signed by him frequently before, and other
Transactions in which he is mentioned to be concerned, also after the
Time of this Voyage, and the only Objection that he could find was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
that the Wife of Major General <i>Gibbons</i> must have had a seven Months
Child, if he went on such Voyage, as it was a Custom in the Church of
<i>Boston</i>, at that Time, that the Child should be brought to be baptized
the <i>Sunday</i> after it was born; and by the Register it appears that this was
the Case, according to the Time that it must be supposed he returned.</p>

<p>The Name was <i>Edward Gibbons</i>; and <i>Seimor</i> is a Mistake of the Translator,
not observing that as <i>de Fonte</i> respectfully stiles <i>Shapley</i> Captain,
he would not mention the Owner by his Christian Name only, a fine
Gentleman and a Major General, but stiles him agreeable thereto after
the <i>Spanish</i> Manner <i>Sennor</i>; and this Mistake of the Translator, as to
the Name, and not observing that the <i>Major General</i> and the Owner
were one and the same Person, shews that the Translator and Editors
knew nothing of the Persons mentioned.</p>

<p>What is said of the largest Colony in <i>New England</i>, called the <i>Maltechusets</i>:
The Dominions of <i>New England</i> consisted, at that Time, of
the Colonies of <i>Plymouth</i>, <i>Massachusets</i>, and <i>Connecticut</i>, of which <i>Massachusets</i>
was the largest, as <i>New Hampshire</i>, <i>Piscatua</i>, and the Province of
<i>Main</i>, were under its Jurisdiction: And it is a little remarkable that the
Admiral should call it the <i>Maltechusets</i>; he apprehended it a Mistake,
though so exact as to the Names <i>Shapley</i> and <i>Gibbons</i>; seems to have
given the Alteration agreeable to his own Ideas, and that it must have
Reference to <i>Malta</i>.</p>

<p>The old Man told them the Ship was of <i>New England</i>, from the Town
called <i>Boston</i>, which was the only Place where they could fit out properly
or conveniently, the Part where <i>Shapley</i> lived consisting only of a
few scattered Houses, and as it was very frequent from <i>Boston</i> to make
Voyages to the Northward, their true Design for further Discoveries
might remain a Secret to all but themselves.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i>'s Address to <i>Gibbons</i> as the Owner, represented so on this Occasion
to serve the Purpose, though the Vessel seems to have been <i>Alexander
Shapley</i>'s, implies that he understood, or took the Advantage on
finding they had been trading with the <i>Indians</i>, that they had two Purposes
in their Undertaking, to discover a Passage, and to trade. As to
the first, <i>de Fonte</i> tells him he had an Order to make a <i>Prize of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
People seeking a West or North-west Passage</i>, speaking in general Terms,
not of them only, so concealing the Advice he had received as to their
particular undertaking of this Discovery; nor could it be peculiarly
understood as to the Subjects of <i>England</i>, for the <i>Danes</i> also, to their
immortal Honour, had before attempted the same Discovery; and in
Consequence let him know that the Part he was in was of the Dominions
of the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, as his Commission could be of no Force
beyond the Extent of that Dominion. <i>De Fonte</i>'s Address likewise implied,
that as he would consider them only as Traders, that he would
not make Prisoners of them on that Account; but expected after this
Adventure that others would learn to keep nearer home, for Fear of
falling into a like Accident, and meeting not with the same favourable
Treatment. Nevertheless he takes effectual Measures to embarrass them
on their Return, and obliges them to stay no longer in those Parts, as he
takes from them what <i>de Fonte</i> calls a small Present of Provisions, which
he had no Need on, but he knew they might, and as to which, the Affair
of Provisions, he gave such an Attention to, through the Course of
his Voyage; and though small what he accepted in respect to the Subsistance
of those he had with him, yet as the Sequel will shew, was afterwards
the Occasion of infinite Distress to the <i>Boston</i> People. The Gift
in return, which is pompously mentioned at twelve Hundred Pieces of
Eight, when we consider the Price Things bore of this Sort where he
purchased it, in <i>Peru</i>, as he estimates by Pieces of Eight, the Manner
of Valuation in those Parts, would not be to <i>Gibbons</i> a Hundred Pounds
Sterling; and the Present to the Seamen must be considered as in lieu
of these Provisions; and by this Means of mutual Presents countenanced
what was absolutely extorted by Force, as was the Case with <i>Shapley</i>, as
to his Charts and Journals, which he would not have parted with, but
constrained through Fear; and by his <i>English</i> Seamen <i>de Fonte</i> could let
them know that the Provisions, Charts, and Journals would be acceptable.
He executed his Design in this Manner, that if the <i>Boston</i> People returned
there could be no proper Foundation for the Court of <i>England</i>
to take Umbrage at his Proceeding.</p>

<p>The Generosity of <i>de Fonte</i> so exceeding what their Present and the
Charts and Journals could be worth, would be considered as to make
them some Satisfaction for their Disappointment; for the Fears they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
been put into, and their being detained there; the Gift of Wine, might
be from a Respect to <i>Major General Gibbons</i>, as an Officer, whom <i>de
Fonte</i> stiles modest, tho' he might perceive it to be the Effect of his Uneasiness
on being thus intercepted. In all other Respects, what he gave
was a Debt which the Crown of <i>Spain</i> would pay, would be considered as
Money advanced in their Service; a Sum of no Consideration with them,
as he had met with these People, procured their Charts by which they got
into the Secret, by what Way they had advanced so far, and probably
very particular Charts and Journals of the other Voyagers whom <i>Gibbons</i>
was acquainted with; and he would endeavour to be furnished with all
Materials which he could probably procure before that he set out. It
would be greatly commended by the Court of <i>Spain</i> the artful Management
of <i>de Fonte</i> in distressing these People, and not with a seeming Intention,
and giving an absolute Discouragement to other Adventurers,
who would be afraid of falling into the <i>Spaniards</i> Hands, whom it would
be supposed constantly frequented those Parts.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> only mentions the Issue of this Affair, what would be immediately
necessary for the Court to know; he mentions no intervening
Circumstances, nor what Time there was between their Examination and
the Presents, whether he or they sailed first, but it must be supposed
they were more than a Day together, and that <i>de Fonte</i> would see them
out of those Parts, as, if they had staid longer, they might probably
have supplied themselves well with Provisions, and proceeded further; but
as they were circumstanced, they would be put under a Necessity to set
out for home, would be glad to leave him the first Opportunity; and as
<i>de Fonte</i> seems to be waiting for a Wind, which he had the sixth of
<i>August</i>, and it had in the interim been fair for the <i>Boston</i> People, they
were certainly gone before that <i>de Fonte</i> set out on his Return.</p>

<p>In the Ecclesiastical History of <i>New England</i>, by the Reverend <i>Cotton
Mather</i>, published at <i>London</i> in 1702, in Folio, in his Account of wonderful
Sea Deliverances, Book the sixth, is <i>The wonderful Story of Major
Gibbons</i>.</p>

<p>'Among remarkable <i>Sea Deliverances</i>, no less than three several
Writers have published that wherein Major <i>Edward Gibbons</i> was concerned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
A Vessel bound from <i>Boston</i> to some other Parts of <i>America</i>,
was, through the Continuance of contrary Winds, kept so
long at Sea, that the People aboard were in extreme straits for Want
of Provision, and seeing that nothing here below could afford them
any Relief, they looked upwards unto Heaven, in humble and fervent
Supplications. The Winds continuing still as they were, one of the
Company made a sorrowful Motion that they should, by a <i>Lot</i>, single
out <i>One</i> to die, and by Death to satisfy the ravenous Hunger of the
rest. After many a doleful and fearful Debate upon this Motion, they
came to a Result, that <i>it must be done</i>! The <i>Lot</i> is cast; one of the
Company is taken; but where is the Executioner that shall do the terrible
Office upon a poor Innocent? It is a Death now to think who
shall act this bloody Part in the Tragedy: But before they fall upon
this involuntary and unnatural Execution, they once more went unto
their zealous <i>Prayers</i>; and, behold, while they were calling upon God,
he answered them, for there leaped a mighty Fish into their Boat,
which, to their double Joy, not only quieted their outrageous Hunger,
but also gave them some Token of a further Deliverance: However,
the Fish is quickly eaten; the horrible <i>Famine</i> returns, the horrible
Distress is renewed; a black Despair again seizes their Spirits:
For another Morsel they come to a second <i>Lot</i>, which fell upon another
Person; but still they cannot find an Executioner: They once
again fall to their importunate Prayers; and, behold, a second Answer
from above; a great Bird lights, and fixes itself on the mast;
one of the Men spies it, and there it stands until he took it by the
Wing with his Hand. This was a second <i>Life from the Dead</i>. This
Fowl, with the Omen of a further Deliverance in it, was a sweet Feast
unto them. Still their Disappointments follow them; they can see
no Land; they know not where they are: Irresistable Hunger once
more pinches them: They have no Hope to be saved but by <i>a third
Miracle</i>: They return to another <i>Lot</i>; but before they go to the
Heart-breaking Talk of slaying the Person under <i>Designation</i>, they repeat
their Addresses unto the God of Heaven, their former <i>Friend in
Adversity</i>; and now they look and look again, but there is nothing:
Their Devotions are concluded, and nothing appears; yet they hoped,
yet they staid, yet they lingered: At last one of them spies a Ship,
which put a new Hope and Life into them all: They bear up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
their Ship; they man their Longboat; they go to board the Vessel,
and are admitted. It proves a <i>French</i> Pyrate: Major <i>Gibbons</i> Petitions
for a little Bread, and offers all for it; but the Commander was one
who had formerly received considerable Kindnesses of Major <i>Gibbons</i>
at <i>Boston</i>, and now replied chearfully, Major <i>Gibbons</i>, not an Hair of
you, or your Company, shall <i>perish if it lies in my Power to</i> preserve
<i>you</i>. Accordingly he supplied their Necessities, and they made a comfortable
End of their Voyage.'</p>

<p>There are nine other Accounts, in each of which the Places the Persons
were bound to are particularly mentioned. In this Account (the
Design being only to shew the wonderful Deliverance of <i>Gibbons</i>) Dr.
<i>Mather</i> could not mention the Place to which the Voyage had been
made in any other Manner, than <i>to some other Parts of America</i>, which
hath an exact Correspondence with the Voyage in which Major <i>Gibbons</i>
was intercepted by <i>de Fonte</i>; for that Voyage was properly to several
Parts, not being to one particular Part of <i>America</i>; which Parts were,
at that Time, nameless. It is said further, that their Misfortune was
occasioned by contrary Winds. <i>De Fonte</i> had a fair Wind from the sixth
of <i>August</i> to the fifth of <i>September</i>, and for a longer Time, so contrary
to the <i>Boston</i> Ship; afterwards they had the Wind again contrary, when
they came into the Ocean, being North-west or to Westward of it, as
they could see no Land; the Land expected to be seen may be supposed
the Land of <i>Newfoundland</i>, or they were to Eastward and Southward of
the Gulph of <i>St. Lawrence</i>: And which Account of the Weather is agreeable
to the Time of the Year that they were there, the latter End of
<i>September</i>, or Beginning of <i>October</i>, being the Equinoctial Gales. Also
as to the Fish which must have been a Sturgeon, which Fish frequently
jump into Boats; and shews, as the Boat was out, that they had then
moderate Weather, but contrary; though a hard Gale succeeded, as
one of the Birds of Passage, which are also then going to Southward,
was blown off the Coast and tired, rested on the Mast. Far be it from
me to reckon these as mere Accidents, and not the Assistances of the Almighty,
but a Relief which the Almighty sent them by Contingencies
which are natural: And as to the Ship, which was a <i>French</i> Pirate, she
had probably come with a fresh Wind out of the Gulph of <i>St. Lawrence</i>,
and Standing to Eastward of <i>Sables</i> to clear that Island and <i>Nautuchet</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
for which she had a fair Wind; and it is said the Commander had an
Acquaintance with Major <i>Gibbons</i>, and received Favours from him at
<i>Boston</i>; but I must add an Anecdote, to shew that there might also be
another Reason assigned, which would not be suitable to be published
with that Account; <i>Alexander Shapley</i> had used to hold a Correspondence
with these Kind of Gentry, as is evident from a severe Censure on him
on that Account, recorded in the Council Book at <i>Boston</i>. It was a
<i>Ship</i> that Major <i>Gibbons</i> was in when intercepted by <i>de Fonte</i>; and
this Account also mentions a Ship. After the Death of <i>Major Gibbons</i>,
his Family, according to the Account of a very ancient Gentlewoman at
<i>Boston</i>, removed to <i>Bermuda</i>; which Lady, who was near ninety Years
of Age, had some traditional Account of the <i>Major</i> having been such a
Voyage to discover a new Way to the <i>East Indies</i>, and suffered much
from the Snow and Ice, went through a great many Hardships, and, she
said, she thought it was from <i>Boston</i> that he set out. The Persons discovered
by Mons. <i>Groseliers</i>, at what he calls an <i>English</i> Settlement, near
Port <i>Nelson</i>, as it is now termed, were <i>Benjamin</i> the Son of Captain <i>Zachary
Gillam</i>, and some others, from <i>Boston</i>, who were the same Year
taken to <i>Canada</i>, whose Journal of that Voyage the Author hath seen,
and this Circumstance is mentioned in it, which Persons have been mistaken
for Major <i>Gibbons</i> and his Company.</p>

<p>'We arrived at the River <i>Parmentiers</i> the 11th of <i>August</i> 86 Leagues,
and was on the South Side Lake <i>Belle</i> on board our Ships the 16th of
<i>August</i>, before the fine Town <i>Conosset</i>, where we found all Things well,
and the honest Natives of <i>Conosset</i> had, in our Absence, treated our
People with great Humanity, and Capt. <i>de Ronquillo</i> answered their
Civility and Justice.'</p>

<p>We have been before told, that the Admiral went sixty Leagues up
<i>Los Reyes</i>, which I take to be the whole Distance between the Entrance
of <i>Los Reyes</i> to <i>Conosset</i> in Lake <i>Belle</i>; and if we transpose the above
Words, 'arrived at <i>Parmentiers</i> the eleventh of <i>August</i>, and was on the
South Side Lake <i>Belle</i> eighty-six Leagues on board our Ships the sixteenth
of <i>August</i>,' then we have the Distances respecting every Part of <i>de
Fonte</i>'s Course thro' Land, from <i>Los Reyes</i> to <i>Conosset</i> sixty Leagues, from
<i>Conosset</i> to Lake <i>de Fonte</i> <i>eighty-six Leagues</i>, from the Entrance of Lake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
<i>de Fonte</i> to the Streight of <i>Ronquillo</i> one Hundred and sixty Leagues,
from the Entrance of the Streight of <i>Ronquillo</i> to the Sea thirty-six
Leagues. The Time that <i>de Fonte</i> was passing down the River of <i>Parmentiers</i>,
and the Time he took to return, are equal, which is plainly
owing to his being obliged to wait the Tides for getting over the Falls
both Ways. The sixth of <i>July</i> they had entered the Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, and
by the fifteenth were through the Streights of <i>Ronquillo</i>, and at the <i>Indian</i>
Town the seventeenth, so they were eleven Days from their Entrance
into the Lake <i>de Fonte</i>; but in their return the same Way only
five, favoured by a strong Current which the Wind occasioned to set into
the Lake, and having as much Wind as they could fly before, and now
came directly back; whereas in their Passage out they had made some
Delays. The Course to <i>Conosset</i> being nearest North-east, I compute it
to be in Lat. 56 Deg. Long. 118° 2´ from <i>London</i>. The Entrance of
Lake <i>de Fonte</i> (supposing the Course of the River <i>Parmentiers</i> and from
<i>Conosset</i> East North East) in Lat. 59° 4´. Long. 113°. The Entrance of
the Streights of <i>Ronquillo</i> East North East, in Lat. 61 Deg. 8 Min.
Long. 98 Deg. 48 Min. the Course through the Streights to enter the
Sea North by East, such Entrance to be in Lat. 62 Deg. 48 Min. Long.
98 Deg. 2 Min. which Course must be consistent with <i>de Fonte</i>'s Account
that a strong Current set in, as by this Course such Current must be accelerated,
if it set to the Southward, by the Wind from the Northward, or if it
was from the Southward, would be opposed in going to the Northward.</p>

<p><i>De Fonte</i> proceeds to give an Account of the good Estate in which
he found all Things on his Return; mentions the Honesty and Humanity
of the Natives, and the prudent Conduct of Captain <i>Ronquillo</i>,
who answered their Civility and Justice. For they had, during the Time
of <i>de Fonte</i>'s Absence, procured, by dealing with the Natives, Store of
good Provisions to salt, Venison, Fish; also one Hundred Hogsheads of
<i>Indian</i> Maiz; besides the Service this would be of on their Return, procured
pursuant to <i>de Fonte</i>'s Order, it employed the People, with the
other necessary Work about the Ships after so long a Run, and kept
them from brangling with the Natives. The Natives were also employed
to their Interest, which preserved them in good Humour; and a Justice
in dealing preserved their Friendship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>'The 20th of <i>August</i> an <i>Indian</i> brought me a Letter to <i>Conosset</i>, on
the Lake <i>Belle</i>, from Captain <i>Bernarda</i>, dated the 11th of <i>August</i>,
where he sent me Word he was returned from his cold Expedition,
and did assure me there was no Communication out of the <i>Spanish</i> or
<i>Atlantick</i> Sea, by <i>Davis</i> Streight; for the Natives had conducted one
of his Seamen to the Head of <i>Davis</i> Streight, which terminated in a
fresh Lake, of about 30 Mile in Circumference, in the 80th Degree
of North Latitude; and that there was prodigious Mountains North
of it, besides the North-west from that Lake the Ice was so fixed, that
from the Shore to 100 Fathom of Water, for ought he knew from the
Creation; for Mankind knew little of the wonderful Works of God,
near the North and South Poles: He writ further, that he
had sailed from <i>Basset</i> Island North East, and East North East, and
North East and by East, to the 79th Degree of Latitude, and the
Land trended North, and the Ice rested on the Land.'</p>

<p>The Orders <i>Bernarda</i> received were to sail up a River North and
North East, North and North West, which River I suppose to have
emptied itself near to <i>Los Reyes</i> into the South-east Part of the <i>South
Sea</i>; and it is not uncommon, in <i>America</i>, that two great Rivers should
have their Entrances contiguous to each other; and I suppose <i>Conabasset</i>,
afterwards called <i>Basset</i>, to be in Lat. 58 Deg. 10 Min. to the Westward
of <i>Los Reyes</i> in Long. 122 Deg. 9 Min. from <i>London</i>. The Course
up the River <i>Haro</i> North 14 Deg. West; and as <i>Conosset</i> is laid down in
Lat. 56 Deg. Long. 118 Deg. 2 Min. the Distance from <i>Basset</i> to <i>Conosset</i>
is one Hundred and seventy-seven Miles; the Course North 46
Deg. West. The Letter by the first Messenger was dated the 27th of
<i>June</i>, and is received the fourth Day, as he could not come a direct
Course, we may suppose he travelled fifty Miles a Day, which is an
extraordinary Allowance, the greatest Part by Water, and Light most of
the Night. We know he would go Part by Water in Lake <i>Belle</i>, and
Lake <i>Belle</i> issuing its Waters both by <i>Los Reyes</i> and the River <i>Parmentiers</i>,
must receive some considerable Influx of Waters by which
it is formed, as well as to give a constant Supply of the Waters
that issue from it, and which must be principally or only from the
Northward, for it cannot be supposed to receive its Waters from the
Southward, and discharge them there again, and which the Messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
would make Use of as soon as possible, and come down Stream. The
second Messenger, who is expresly mentioned to be an <i>Indian</i>, is nine
Days a coming. But <i>Bernarda</i> mentions nothing as to his Ship or People
in this Account, only says he is returned from his cold Expedition,
therefore probably he sent away the <i>Indian</i> as soon as he could after he
entered the River, which ran into the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea, in Lat. 61. If
this was the Case, we may suppose that the Waters which came into the
Lake <i>Belle</i> head a great Way up in the Country.</p>

<p><i>Bernarda</i> had Directions, after he left Lake <i>Valasco</i>, to sail one Hundred
and forty Leagues West, and then four Hundred and thirty Leagues
North East by East to seventy-seven Degrees of Latitude. <i>Bernarda</i>,
in his Letter of the 27th of <i>June</i> observes, there was a River eighty
Leagues in Length, not comprehended in his Instructions or Orders,
and emptied itself in the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea; and says, in his Letter of the
11th of <i>August</i>, that he sailed from the Island <i>Basset</i> North-east; with that
Course, when he entered the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea, in Latitude 61, his Longitude
would be 116 Deg. he then begins the Course <i>de Fonte</i> directed
him, one Hundred and forty Leagues East North East; and he mentions
on his Return he had steered that Course, keeping the Land aboard. So
that <i>West</i> and the Land trending <i>North East</i>, are Mistakes in the Publication
in <i>April</i>; but the mentioning how the Land trended, shews he
was then entering the Sea; for to talk of Land, with respect to a River,
is absurd; and with the Course and Distance he steered would be
in Lat. 63 Deg. 39 Min. and Long. 110 Deg. from <i>London</i>: Then he
steers four Hundred and thirty-six Leagues North East and by East, and that
brings him into Latitude 79 Deg. Long. 87 Deg. from <i>London</i>. But
the Land trending North, and with Ice, which would be dangerous for
the <i>Periagos</i>; and as the Land trended North, where he was appearing
to him to be the nearest Part he could attain to to go to the Head of
<i>Davis</i> Streight; and as to the Distance over Land, and the Propriety
of sending a Messenger, the <i>Indians</i> would inform him; he sends a Seaman
over with an <i>Indian</i> to take a Survey of the Head of such Streights,
by us called <i>Baffin</i>'s Bay; which Name was not at that Time generally
received. Which Seaman reports, that it terminated in the eightieth
Degree of Latitude, in a Lake of about thirty Miles in Circumference,
with prodigious Mountains North of it, which indeed formed that Lake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
or is a Sound, as that of Sir <i>James Lancaster</i> and of <i>Alderman Jones</i>;
and along the Shore, from the Lake North-west, the Ice was fixed,
lying a great Distance out, which was very consistent with there being no
Inlets there, the Waters from which would have set it off. The Distance
that the <i>Indian</i> and Sailor travelled would not exceed fifty Miles; and
their mentioning the high Mountains to Northward imply, that they
were in a more level Country where they were to take this View. Light
all Night, the Snow off the Ground, and the Heighth of Summer there.
It is no vain Conjecture to suppose that the Journey was practicable,
even if performed all the Way by Land, and much easier, which is not
the least improbable, if they had an Opportunity of making Part of it by
Water. <i>Bernarda</i> proceeding thus far in the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea, and entering
in Latitude 61, is no Way contradictory to the <i>Russian</i> Discoveries;
and by the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea is meant, the Sea which washes the Northern
Coasts of <i>Tartary</i>, and is supposed to extend round the Pole. Those
Discoveries are agreeable to the <i>Japanese</i> Map, as to the North-east
Parts of <i>Asia</i>, and North-west Parts of <i>America</i>, brought over by <i>Kemper</i>,
and in which Map there is expressed a Branch of the <i>Tartarian</i> Sea or Gulph,
extending to the Southward, agreeable to this Account of <i>de Fonte</i>. Who
calls it, with respect to <i>Asia</i>, the North and East Part of the <i>Tartarian</i>
Sea. Which compared with what <i>de Fonte</i> says, as to sailing down the
River to the North-east Part of the <i>South Sea</i>, these Expressions cast a
mutual Light on each other, and that the <i>Archipelagus of Saint Lazarus</i>
is a Gulph or Branch of the Sea, in the like Manner.</p>

<p>Places which are in one and the same Latitude, have not an equal
Degree of Heat or Cold, or are equally fertile or barren, the Difference
in these Respects chiefly consists in their Situation. The Country of <i>Labrador</i>,
which is to Eastward of <i>Hudson</i>'s <i>Bay</i>, in Latitude 56, almost as
high a Latitude as Port <i>Nelson</i>, is a Country capable of being improved
by Agriculture, and would supply all the Necessaries of Life, though
intermixed with rugged and craggy Mountains. The Winter's not so
severe as in the more Southern Parts of <i>Hudson</i>'s <i>Bay</i>, as the Earth
is not froze there, as it is in the same and lower Latitudes about that
Bay: Also People have wintered in the <i>Labrador</i>, wearing only their
usual Cloathing: Therefore drawing a Parallel between Port <i>Nelson</i> and
<i>Conosset</i>, as to the Infertility of one, therefore the other being in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
same Latitude, could not produce Maiz to supply <i>Ronquillo</i>,
is an Objection which hath no Foundation in it. The higher the Latitude the
quicker is the Vegetation; and as <i>Indian Corn</i> or <i>Maiz</i> may be planted
and gathered in three Months in lower Latitudes, it may be in an equal
or less Time in higher Latitudes, in a good Soil. As to Port <i>Nelson</i>, or
<i>York Fort</i>, in <i>Hudson</i>'s <i>Bay</i>, it is a low Country through which two large
Rivers pass, with the Bay in Front, and nothing is certainly known of
the more inland Parts.</p>

<p>The physical Obstacles that are produced against our giving Credit to
this Account of <i>de Fonte</i>, from the Depth of the Falls at the Entrance of
Lake <i>Belle</i> in the River <i>Parmentiers</i>, and from the River <i>Bernarda</i> passed
up, are, from not understanding what is expressed by the Word Falls
amongst the <i>Americans</i>. They mean by a Fall wherever there is the
least Declivity of the Water; and the Fall of thirty-two Feet in the River
<i>Parmentiers</i>, doth not mean a perpendicular Fall, as the Objector
would have it understood, however ridiculous to suppose it, but eight
gradual Descents, from the Beginning of which to the Extremity of the
last there was a Difference of thirty-two Feet, and which became level
or even at the Time of high Water.</p>

<p>What <i>Bernarda</i> says as to his cold Expedition, a Person used to the
Climate of <i>Peru</i> might justly say so, of the Nights and Evenings
and Mornings, at that Time of the Year, in the Latitude of seventy-nine,
though temperate in Latitude fifty-six; and the whole Disposition
of the Country, the immense high Lands, their barren and desert Aspect,
in Places their Summits covered with perpetual Snow, the Ice fixed to
the Shores, Sheets of floating Ice in the Waters, the immense Islands,
frequently seeing Whales, Sea-horse, and a great Variety of the Inhabitants
of those Waters, which do not frequent the Southern Parts: The
Whole a Scene so different from the Verdure and Delights of the Plains
about <i>Lima</i>, and from the pleasing Views that present themselves on running
along the Coasts of <i>Peru</i>, <i>Bernarda</i> might well be affected with such
Scene as to express himself, that Mankind knew little of the wonderful
Works of God, especially near the North and the South Poles. But he
was not so ignorant as to report, that he saw Mountains of Ice on the
Land, as well as in the Sea, though he might see them forming between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Points of Land, which jetted out into the Sea; and such a Column of
Ice would appear to him as something very curious.</p>

<p>That these Parts were inhabited does not appear, for it was a Native
of <i>Conibasset</i> that conducted the Seaman over the Land; and, at that
Season of the Year, the fresh Waters are thawed, no Snow on the
low and level Lands, only on the extreme Summits of the Hills.</p>

<p>What is objected as to the Affability of the Inhabitants, that it is not
consistent with the Character of the <i>Indians</i>. Hospitality is the Characteristick
of the <i>Indians</i> towards Strangers, until such Time as they are
prejudiced from some ill Treatment; and by the Account given by Sir
<i>Francis Drake</i>, as to the <i>Indians</i> of <i>California</i>, and by the <i>Spaniards</i> who
surveyed the Western Coasts, and the Islands lying off, they are represented
in general as a kind, tractable People, and of a docile Temper.</p>

<p>As to the Dispatch used by <i>Indians</i> in carrying Expresses, or their
Runners as they term them, to carry Messages from one Nation to another,
they will gird themselves up with the Rhind of Trees, and keep
going incessantly great Distances with a surprising Agility Night and
Day, taking little either of Sleep or other Refreshments, and keep a
direct Course, and in the Night steer either by the Moon or Stars. Nor
is there any Thing miraculous in these Journeys, which the Expresses
performed, either as to Distance or as to Time, especially as they passed
through a Country abounding with Waters, and which Country being inhabited
they could be supplied with Canoes, or they would find Floats
at the Places where they usually pass the Waters.</p>

<p><i>Bernarda</i> meeting <i>de Fonte</i> at a Port up the River <i>Rio los Reyes</i>, shews
he had Persons aboard who could direct him there, therefore must have
been previously there; and they can be supposed to be no other than the
Jesuits, which is a further Proof of the Jesuits having been before in these
Parts. It was consistent that the Ships should join and return home
together. From where <i>Bernarda</i> came to with his Ship was one Hundred
and twenty Miles to <i>Conosset</i>: His Letter from thence was dated
the 29th of <i>August</i>, and <i>de Fonte</i> sailed the second of <i>September</i>: It may
be supposed the Letter came to Hand the first of <i>September</i>, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
four Days, and the Express had now all the Way by Water, and mostly
against Stream. <i>De Fonte</i>, to shew that he had preserved the Affection
of the Natives, mentions that he was accompanied with them; and
they were of Assistance to him in the Pilotage down the River. <i>De
Fonte</i> adds, he had sent a Chart with the Letter, which is misunderstood,
as if such Chart had come to the Hands of the Editors; <i>which will
make this much more demonstrative</i>, were Words added by them; but it
was usual in all the Naval Expeditions to have Persons aboard whom
they called <i>Cosmographers</i>, to take Draughts of Places, and compose
their Charts, and at that Time a very reputable Employment.</p>

<p><i>Miguel Venegas</i>, a <i>Mexican</i> Jesuit, published at <i>Madrid</i> in 1758, a Natural
and Civil History of <i>California</i>; a Translation of which was published
in <i>London</i> in 1759, in two Volumes; and Vol. i. P. 185, says,
'To this Æra (the last Voyage he mentions was in 1636) belongs the
Contents of a Paper published at <i>London</i>, under the Title of the Narrative
of <i>Bartholomew de Fuentes</i>, Commander in Chief of the Navy in
<i>New Spain</i> and <i>Peru</i>, and President of <i>Chili</i>, giving an Account of the
most remarkable Transactions and Adventures in this Voyage, for the
Discovery of a Passage from the <i>South Sea</i>, to that of the North in the
Northern Hemisphere, by Order of the Viceroy of <i>Peru</i> in the Year 1640.
This Writing contains several Accounts relating to <i>California</i>; but
without entering into long Disputes, let it suffice to say, that little
Credit is to be given to this Narrative. For the same Reason we have
before omitted the Accounts of Voyages made from the <i>South Sea</i> to
the North round beyond <i>California</i>, and those of a contrary Direction,
of which an Account is given by Captain <i>Seixas</i> and <i>Lobero</i>, in <i>Theatro
Naval</i>, in <i>Spanish</i> and <i>French</i>; and particularly of that <i>Spaniard</i>
who is supposed, in three Months, to have come from <i>Puerto de Navidad</i>
and <i>Cabo Corientes</i> to <i>Lisbon</i>. These and other Accounts dispersed
in different Books, we designedly omit, as they want the necessary
Authenticity.'</p>

<p>This Work was published with a Design to induce the Court of <i>Spain</i>
to a further Conquest of, an intire Reduction of, and the full settling
of <i>California</i>, as of the utmost Importance to Religion and the State;
and one of the Arguments is, for their immediate putting what he recommends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
in Execution, the repeated Attempts of the <i>English</i> to find
a Passage into the <i>South Sea</i>. And observes, 'Should they one Day succeed
in this, why may not the <i>English</i> come down through their Conquests,
and even make themselves Masters of <i>New Mexico</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>' which
implies, that he did not look on such an Attempt as void of all Hopes
of Success; and he again says, 'Whoever is acquainted with the present
Disposition of the <i>English</i> Nation, and has heard with what Zeal
and Ardour the Project for a North-west Passage has been espoused by
many considerable Persons, will be convinced that the Scheme is not
romantick, and it would not be surprizing if the Execution of it should
one Day come under Deliberation.' Thus artfully hints, should the
Scheme come under Deliberation, the Event would be to be feared;
and though he ascribes his Opinion of its not being romantick, is, to
many considerable Persons having espoused the Scheme, yet he tacitly applies
to their own Knowledge, to what the Court of <i>Spain</i> knows as to
this Passage. He then proceeds, 'If this should ever happen,' the Deliberation,
'what would be the Condition of our Possessions?' The
Deliberation would, from Consequences that would follow on such a
Deliberation, endanger our Possessions.</p>

<p><i>Don Cortez</i> informed the King, by a Letter of the 15th of <i>October</i>
1524, that he was building two Ships, to get a Knowledge of the Coast
yet undiscovered between the River of <i>Panaco</i> and <i>Florida</i>, and from
thence to the Northern Coast of the said Country of <i>Florida</i>, as far as
the <i>Baccaloo</i>, 'It being certain, as he expresses himself, that on that
Coast is a Streight running into the <i>South Sea</i>'&mdash;'God grant that the
Squadron may compass the End for which it is designed, namely, to
discover the Streight, which I am fully persuaded they will do, because
in the Royal Concerns of your Majesty nothing can be concealed;
and no Diligence or Necessaries shall be wanting in me to effect
it.' Again, 'I hereby inform your Majesty, that by the Intelligence
I have received of the Countries on the upper Coast of the
sending the Ships along, it will be attended with great Advantage to
me, and no less to your Majesty. But acquainted as I am with your
Majesty's Desire of knowing this Streight, and likewise of the great
Service it would be to your Royal Crown.' Vol. i. P. 130.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>Agreeable to this Letter several Attempts were made by Sea to discover
whether <i>Florida</i> was Part of the Continent, or separated by a Streight;
but whether <i>Cortez</i> pursued his Design by searching between <i>Florida</i>
along the Coast of <i>Baccaloos</i>, <i>Newfoundland</i>, and the <i>Terra de Labrador</i>,
for a Streight, by which there was a Passage from the <i>North</i> to the
<i>South Sea</i> is uncertain. <i>Florida</i> comprehended the Country from the
Cape of <i>Labrador</i> to the Cape <i>de los Martires</i>, or of <i>Martyrs</i>, opposite to
the Island of <i>Cuba</i>. From thence to the Streights of <i>Magellan</i> was
called <i>Peruan Part</i>.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Portugal</i>, with a View of finding a shorter Passage to
those Parts of the <i>Indies</i>, which he had discovered, than by the Cape of
<i>Good Hope</i>, sent, in the Year fifteen Hundred, <i>Gasper de Corte Real</i> to
the North of <i>America</i>, who landed on the <i>Terra de Labrador</i>; also gave
his Name to a Promontory on that Coast which he called <i>Promonterium
Corteriale</i>. The Name of <i>Labrador</i> implies a fertile Country, and given
in Distinction from the high barren mountainous Country to Northward,
which <i>Gasper</i> discovered in Latitude sixty, and to the Southward of it.
But this Distinction seems to have been soon lost, and the Name of <i>Labrador</i>
is now given to the whole Coast.</p>

<p>From the Knowledge we have of these Parts we may conclude, that
the <i>Promonterium Corteriale</i> was what we at present name <i>Cape Chidley</i>,
and the Islands <i>de Demonios</i>, where <i>Gasper</i> lost a Vessel, those Islands
now named <i>Button</i>'s Islands; and it was <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights to which he
gave the Name of the River of the <i>Three Brothers</i>, though the Reason
of his giving that Name is not known to us.</p>

<p>We may perceive from this Account of <i>Gasper</i>'s Voyage, who did not
proceed to Westward to make a Passage, but coasted down the main
Land, the Accounts of their being a <i>Portuguese</i> who made a Voyage
through the Streights of <i>Anian</i>, calling a Promontory after his Name
<i>Promonterium Corteriale</i>, hath had some Foundation in Truth; and in
what is said by <i>Frisius</i>, an antient Geographer, calling it the Streights
of <i>Three Brothers</i>, or <i>Anian</i> (which that Word imports) because three
Brothers had passed through a Streight from the <i>North</i> to the <i>South Sea</i>.
It is also apparent that the Name of <i>Anian</i> was first given by <i>Gasper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
Corterialis</i> (for some particular Reason unknown to us) to that Part,
which is now <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights. Though in Time this became a proper
Name to express a Streight by which there is a Passage from the <i>North</i>
to the <i>South Sea</i>, and is contended for to be the proper Name of
the Streight that divides <i>Asia</i> from <i>America</i>, by which there is a Communication
with the <i>Tartarian</i> and <i>Southern Ocean</i>. After a Discovery
of these Coasts had been made to Northward, the following Year the
King of <i>Portugal</i> sent <i>Americus Vespusino</i> to Southward, to discover the
Land there.</p>

<p><i>Cortez</i>'s Designs seem to have their Foundation in these Expeditions
of the <i>Portuguese</i>; but it was not until after the Year 1513, that the
<i>South Sea</i> was discovered, and the <i>Portugueze</i> had discovered the <i>Moluccas</i>,
that the finding a Streight to the Northward, by which a Passage
might be made to the <i>South Sea</i>, became a Matter of particular Attention,
and was the first and principal Object of <i>Cortez</i>'s Attention after
he had become Master of the Capital of <i>Mexico</i> in 1521; and this Opinion
of a Passage to Northward continued during the Reign of <i>Charles</i>
the Fifth. Who in the Year 1524 sent from <i>Old Spain</i> to discover a Passage
to the <i>Moluccas</i> by the North of <i>America</i>, without Success; but
<i>Esteven Gomez</i>, who was sent on that Expedition, brought some <i>Indians</i>
home with him. Then in the Year 1526 <i>Charles</i> the Fifth wrote to <i>Cortez</i>,
in Answer to his Letters, and orders him to send the Ships at <i>Zacapila</i>
to discover a Passage from <i>New Spain</i> to the <i>Moluccas</i>.</p>

<p>From this Time, the Year 1526, the Opinion of there being a Streight
was generally received, though on what Foundation does not appear.
It was certainly on some better Reason than <i>Gasper</i>'s Discoveries; and a
Consideration of the Importance such a Passage would be of to the King
of <i>Spain</i> with respect to the <i>Spice</i> Islands. It is not consistent with the Characters
of the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, and of <i>Cortez</i>, when there were
so many other solid Projects to pursue and this was preferred, to suppose
that they should go, at that Time, on a meer visionary Scheme.</p>

<p>The same Opinion of a Passage to Northward prevailed in the Time
of <i>Philip</i> the Second, and in the Year 1596 he sent Orders to the Viceroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of <i>Mexico</i> for discovering and making Settlements in proper Parts of
<i>California</i>, and one Reason assigned was, 'There was much Talk about
the Streight of <i>Anian</i>, through which the <i>South Sea</i> was said to communicate
with that of the <i>North</i>, near <i>Newfoundland</i>; and should the
<i>English</i> find out a practicable Passage on that Side, our Dominions,
which then included all <i>Portuguese India</i>, would be no longer secure,
all the Coast from <i>Acapulco</i> to <i>Culiacan</i> being quite defenceless, and
from <i>Culiacan</i> Northward, not one single Settlement was made on the
whole Coast.' Hist. Cal. V. i. P. 163. That now not only the Opinion
of there being a Streight prevailed, but it was also fixed as to the
Part, and had the Name of <i>Anian</i>.</p>

<p>The Opinion of a Passage still existed in the Reign of <i>Philip</i> the
Third; and the same political Motives induced him to order the Conquest
of <i>California</i> to be undertaken with all possible Expedition; and
one Reason assigned is, 'His Majesty also found among other Papers a
Narrative delivered by some Foreigners to his Father, giving an Account
of many remarkable Particulars which they saw in that Country,
when driven thither by Stress of Weather from the Coast of <i>Newfoundland</i>;
adding, they had passed from the <i>North Sea</i> to the <i>South</i>, by
the Streight of <i>Anian</i>, which lies beyond Cape <i>Mendocino</i>; and that
they had arrived at a populous and opulent City, walled and well
fortified, the Inhabitants living under a regular Policy, and were a sensible
and courteous People; with many other Particulars well worth
a further Enquiry.' It must be considered this is given us in the History
of <i>California</i>, V. ii. P. 239, from the <i>Monarchia Indiana</i> of <i>Juan
Torquemada</i>, a learned <i>Franciscan</i>, published at <i>Madrid</i> in 1613, and
republished in 1723, Vol. i. P. 629, That a Paper of this Sort was found
in the Cabinet of <i>Philip</i> the Second, was thought deserving the Attention
of <i>Philip</i> the Third. However the Matter of it is represented here,
for nothing could be published but what was first perused and altered,
so as to make it consistent with the Interest of Holy Church, the State,
or good Manners, before it was licensed, such Paper must have contained
some material Intelligence as to a Passage; and if is said to have contained
<i>some remarkable Particulars</i>. Neither would the Work have been
licensed, if what is related as to their having been such a Paper, had
not been true.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p><i>Torquemada</i>, Vol. i. P. 20, quotes <i>Francisco Lopez de Gomara</i>, deemed
a careful Writer, and Author of the History of the <i>Indies</i>. Who says the
Snowy Mountains are in forty Degrees, and the furthermost Land that is
laid down in our Maps; but the Coast runs to the Northward until it
comes to form an Island by the <i>Labrador</i>, or as separated from <i>Greenland</i>;
and this Extremity of the Land is five Hundred and ten Leagues in Length.</p>

<p>As to what is said as to the Latitude of forty Degrees in this Quotation
from <i>Gomara</i>, <i>Torquemada</i> hath prefixed a Map to his Work, <i>agreeable</i>
to that formed by the King's Cosmographers, in which he hath
made the most Western and Northern Part of the Land in almost forty-seven
Degrees, and then the Land trends to the Eastward, and the <i>Serras
Nevadas</i> are represented to extend a great Length along the Coast,
and to Latitude 57 Degrees. Mentions, Vol. i. P. 16, the Royal Cosmographers
do not insert any Thing in their Charts of the Sea Coasts but
what they have upon Oath, or from creditable Persons; and 'They make
a Supputation in the Northern Parts of Islands, which do not lie near or
contiguous to the Lands of <i>Europe</i>; as to which Islands, not long since
discovered, the one is called <i>Iceland</i>, the other <i>Greenland</i>, which are
the Bounds, Limits, or Marks, that divide the Land of the <i>Indies</i>
from any other Part howsoever situated or disposed;' afterwards observes,
which Islands are not far from the <i>Labrador</i>; from which it is
plain he calls <i>America</i> an Island. And this is agreeable to what <i>Acosta</i>
says, in the Sense which I understand him, that <i>Quivira</i> and <i>Anian</i> extend
to the Western Extremity of <i>America</i>; and that the Extremity of the
Kingdom of <i>Anian</i> to the North extends under the <i>Polar</i> or <i>Artick</i> Circle,
and, if the Sea did not prevent it, would be found to join the Countries
of <i>Tartary</i> and <i>China</i>; and the Streight of <i>Anian</i> takes its Course through
the Northern Region, under the Polar Circle, towards <i>Greenland</i>, <i>Iceland</i>,
<i>England</i>, and to the Northern Parts of <i>Spain</i>. By <i>Greenland</i> I understand
the Land to Northward, which is the North Part of <i>Hudson</i>'s
Streights, and <i>Cumberland</i> Isles; and that this Streight should determine
here is agreeable to what <i>Cortez</i> says he would send to search as far as
the <i>Baccallaos</i>, (which was a Name given by <i>Cabot</i> in 1496) for the
Streight by which he expected a Passage from the <i>North</i> to the <i>South Sea</i>.
By <i>Iceland</i> is meant, as is apparent from a View of such Map hereunto annexed,
the Land to Northward of Cape <i>Farewel</i>, or the <i>Proper Greenland</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
<i>Gomara</i> mentions these Islands had not been long discovered. It is apparent
from the Map, that they had a very imperfect Account of these
Discoveries, which were made by <i>Frobisher</i> and <i>Davis</i>, who also were far
from being exact in their Computations of the Longitude.</p>

<p>In this Map prefixed to <i>Torquemada</i>'s Work, and here annexed, the
Southern Part of <i>Newfoundland</i> is laid down in Lat. 55, nine Degrees more
to the Northward than it ought to be, for which Reason the <i>Labrador</i>, <i>Greenland</i>,
and <i>Iceland</i>, are placed much further to Northward than they ought
to be placed, and are made to extend beyond the Polar Circle. It is from
this Supposition of <i>Newfoundland</i> being in so high a Latitude that <i>Acosta</i>
says, <i>the Streight of Anian</i> takes its Course through the Northern Region
under the Polar Circle towards <i>Greenland</i> and <i>Iceland</i>. In the same
Map the extremest Point of <i>California</i>, answerable to Cape <i>St. Lucas</i>, is
laid down in Longitude 105 Degrees from the Meridian of <i>Ferro</i>, and
the Extremity of the Land to Westward a Cape to Northward of Cape
<i>Fortunes</i>, but to which no Name is given, and in Latitude 47, is placed
in 135 Degrees from the Meridian of <i>Ferro</i>; the Difference of Longitude
is 30 Degrees. This Map, published by <i>Torquemada</i>, was constructed
before the Year 1612, therefore prior to a Map published in <i>Holland</i> in
1619, under the Title of <i>Nova Totius Orbis Descriptio</i>, prefixed to the
Voyage of <i>George Spilbergen</i>, in which the Errors of <i>Torquemada</i>'s Map,
as to the Situation of <i>Newfoundland</i>, and the Places to Northward are
corrected; yet great Errors are committed as to the Parts to Westward
of <i>America</i>, making eighty-five Degrees of Longitude between Cape <i>St.
Lucas</i> and the Extremity of the Land to Westward and Northward in
Lat. 42; and ninety-five Degrees between Cape <i>St. Lucas</i> and the Extremity
of the Land nearest to <i>Asia</i>. The Reason of this Difference is
plain, they both err with respect to those Parts, of which they had not
authenticated Accounts.</p>

<p><i>Cortez</i> wrote to the Emperor that he had sent People on Discovery,
both by Land and Water, it was not designed that their Discoveries
should be communicated, as <i>Cortez</i> intended to turn them
to his own private Advantage. But when <i>Mendoza</i> fitted out two Armaments,
one by Land under the Command of <i>Coronado</i>, and the
other by Sea under <i>Alarcon</i>; <i>Alarcon</i> was ordered to Latitude 53, to
join the Land Forces, and to make a Survey of the Coast, and see if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
there was a Passage or a Communication by Water through those Countries
which <i>Coronado</i> was to discover and subdue, with the <i>South Sea</i>. As
to <i>Coronado</i>, the <i>Franciscans</i> had been before in those Parts, and they
gave Information and Direction as to his Part of the Expedition; but as
to the Part that <i>Alarcon</i> had, on what Information he was ordered to go
to Latitude 53, and what Probability there was that it was possible for
him to find such Passage, and join the Land Forces, does not appear.
But from his not finding such Passage, not joining the Land Forces, and
proceeding no further than the Lat. 36, though his Reason for not going
further is, that the Land then trended to the Northward, which
he supposed would put him further off from the Army, whom he
knew were in ten Days March of him, and the Excuse of Sickness and
ill Condition of his Vessels, occasioned him to return before his
Time; yet his Conduct threw the whole Disgrace of the ill Success of
that Expedition on <i>Alarcon</i>, both with the Emperor and the Viceroy:
And what he wrote to the Emperor was not attended to. He wrote to
the Emperor, 'That it was for him only, and not in Subordination to
the Viceroy, that he had conquered, discovered, and entered on the
<i>Californias</i>, and all those Lands on the Coasts of the <i>South Sea</i>; that
he had learnt that some of those Lands were not far from the Coasts
of <i>Grand China</i>; that there was but a small Navigation to the <i>Spice</i>
Islands, which he knew was wished for at that Time; that it engaged
all his Thoughts, and was his most ardent Desire to undertake such
Navigation.' <i>Torquem.</i> Vol. i. P. 609.</p>

<p>On <i>Alarcon</i>'s Return <i>Juan Rodrique de Cabrillo</i> was fitted out, who
went as far as Lat. 44. Sickness, Want of Provisions, and his Ships
not being of sufficient Strength for those Northern Seas, obliged him to
return, though he was designed to go further to Northward. The Ships
returning from the <i>Philippines</i>, which was also an Expedition in the Time
of Viceroyship of <i>Mendoza</i>, fell in with the Land in Lat. 42, and found
it all to be <i>Terra Firma</i>, from a Cape there, which they named <i>Mendocino</i>
to the Port of <i>La Navidad</i>. In 1602 <i>Vizcaino</i> went, and then the
Discovery was made by <i>Martin de Aguilar</i>; and <i>Torquemada</i> tells us,
Vol. i. Lib. 5. P. 725. That if there had not been, only fourteen healthy
Persons when they were at Cape <i>Blanco</i>, they were resolved to pass thro'
the Streight, which they named <i>Anian</i>, and which Streight is said to be
there; and P. 719, speaking of the Entrance of <i>Martin Aguilar</i>, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
understood to be a River, by which you may pass to a great City, which
the <i>Hollanders</i> discovered coming through the Streight, which is the
Streight of <i>Anian</i>, and which City, he says, was named <i>Quivira</i>.</p>

<p>These Voyages, and we have Accounts of no others, could not have
furnished the Cosmographers the principal Materials for composing their
Map, and it must have been agreeable to those Materials, besides the
Accounts of these Voyages sent to <i>Old Spain</i>, that they set down the
utmost Limits of the Western Coast to be in the Longitude of 135
Decrees from the Meridian of <i>Ferro</i>. Therefore it was their Opinion
at that Time that one Hundred and thirty-five Degrees was near the
Difference of Longitude of the Entrance of the Streight of <i>Anian</i> in
the <i>South Sea</i>, accounting the Longitude from the Meridian of <i>Ferro</i>.
For which Reason the <i>Spaniards</i> can never be understood to mean by the
Streight of <i>Anian</i> the Streight which separates <i>Asia</i> and <i>America</i>, now
named <i>Beering</i>'s <i>Streight</i>, and by which there is a Communication between
the Sea of <i>Tartary</i>, or the <i>Frozen Ocean</i>, and the <i>South Sea</i>.</p>

<p>It is something remarkable, and supports what hath been before said
as to Deficiency of the <i>Spanish</i> Records, what Jesuit <i>Venegas</i>, the Author
of the History of <i>California</i>, says, Vol. ii. P. 228, 'I was extremely
desirous of finding Capt. <i>Sebastian Vizcaino</i>'s Narrative, and the Representations
of the Council to his Majesty <i>Philip</i> the Third, especially
the Maps, Plans, Charts of his Voyage and Discoveries, in order to
communicate the Whole to the Publick. Accordingly at my Request
Search was made in the Secretary's Office of the Council of the <i>Indies</i>:
But in this Intention of being serviceable to the Publick I have been
disappointed.' And he again observes, on the Governor of <i>Cinaloa</i>
being ordered to pass over and take a Survey of the Coasts, Islands,
Bays, Creeks, and the Disposition of the Ground of <i>California</i>, in the
Year 1642, Vol. i. P. 188, 'There would have been little Occasion,
says he, for this preparatory Survey, after so many others which had
been continually making for above a Century, had the Reports, Narratives,
Charts, Draughts and Maps, which were made, or should
have been made, by so many Discoveries still continued in being.
But these are the Effects of a Want of a proper Care in preserving Papers,
a Fault to be regretted by Persons in Power, to whom they
would be of Service in the Conduct of Affairs, and by private Persons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
on the Account of their Interest, or as Entertainments of a commendable
Curiosity.'&mdash;'But by the Loss of some Papers, either thro'
a Change in the Government, or Irregularity in the Records, the whole
Advantage of an Expedition is lost.'</p>

<p>From this Declaration by one who being a Jesuit, and of <i>Mexico</i>,
composing a Work entirely for the publick Service, under the Direction
of the Jesuits; by their Influence could attain the Sight of any Papers
which were thought interesting as to the Work he was composing; and
his last Reflection is not confined to the Records of <i>Old Spain</i> only; it
is apparent what Uncertainty there is of attaining any Evidence from such
Records, as to the Discoveries made in the first Century after the Conquest
of <i>Mexico</i>, and for a long Time after. The Narrative of <i>Vizcaino</i>'s
Voyage, and every Thing thereto relating, as to any remaining Records
might have become disputable, had not <i>Torquemada</i> collected it, and published
it amongst other Accounts; yet what <i>Torquemada</i> hath preserved
is but imperfect, as is apparent from a Journal of that Voyage, preserved
in a private Hand at <i>Manilla</i>, and a Sight of large Extracts from
which the Author hath been favoured by a Gentleman in <i>London</i>. It is
owing to what <i>Torquemada</i> and some others have collected of the Accounts
which the Religious were the Authors of, that the Publick have
the Accounts of those Parts; but such Voyages and Accounts as have
not met with the same Means of being preserved, the Publick, from
such Neglect, know nothing of them. It is plain from <i>Gomara</i>'s Account,
also from <i>Acosta</i>'s, that great Discoveries had been made in these
Parts, but as to many of such Discoveries, by whom is not known;
and <i>Venegas</i> says, Vol. i. P. 30, the River <i>Santo Thome</i> was discovered in
the Year 1684; 'And tho' I do not find, says he, in the Narratives of
that Expedition (of Admiral <i>Otondo</i>) that <i>Otondo</i> ever went ashore
only to visit the Harbours of the Eastern Coast and the Gulph; yet
from the ardent Curiosity of Father <i>Kino</i>, and the great Concern he
had in the Affairs of <i>California</i>, I cannot think that he should be
mistaken in any Particular relating to the Discovery: That Father
<i>Kino</i>, both in his large Manuscript Map, and likewise in the lesser Impression,
places the River of <i>Santo Thome</i> as rising between the 26th
and 27th Degrees of N. Latitude, and, after crossing the whole Peninsula,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
discharging itself into the <i>South Sea</i>, in the 26th Deg. and forming
at its Mouth a large Harbour, which he calls <i>Puerto de Anno Nuevo</i>,
being discovered in the Year 1685. On both Sides the River are
Christian Villages, as is evident from their Names; <i>Santiago</i>, <i>Santo
Innocentes</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> yet, in the Accounts of that Time, I do not meet with
any Intelligence of this Discovery; to which I must add, that in the
subsequent Relations no mention is made of any such River, Settlements
or Harbours, though even little Brooks, are taken Notice of.'
And he observes many other Difficulties occur about this Coast. This
Harbour made by the River <i>Santo Thome</i>, is evidently that which <i>de
Fonte</i> and others call <i>Christabel</i>. Some Settlements had been made there,
as these Names were given, but either deserted from the Barrenness of
the Country, or had been only frequented by those who went out private
Adventurers, in order to trade with the Natives. But as to which River,
Settlements and Harbour, were not the Names preserved by Father
<i>Kino</i>, it would not have been known that any Persons had been in
those interior Parts of <i>California</i>, or that there were such River and
Harbour. Father <i>Kino</i> looked upon it as a Thing so well known, as
he had no Occasion to defend himself, by giving the Reason of his
inserting those Names to protect himself from the Reproach of Posterity.
And <i>Venegas</i> before tells us, that as to the Discoveries which had
been made for a Century passed, the Papers were lost.</p>

<p>Between the Year sixteen Hundred and eighty-five, and the Time of
<i>Venegas</i>'s Publication, though in the Year sixteen Hundred and eighty-five,
it was well known that there was such a River as <i>St. Thome</i>, this River
is exploded out of the Maps by the Geographers, on Account of the
Uncertainty; not duly considering that there was as full a Proof as could
be required with respect to so unfrequented a Part. The Account being
from a Person whose Business it was to make Observations there, who
had been so laborious and accurate as to discover, what had been so
long desired to be known, whether <i>California</i> was an Island or not, as
to which he was believed; and the Truth hath been confirmed by later
Observations of what he had reported, That it was not an Island. Therefore
there was no Foundation for any Uncertainty in this Case, the same as
with respect to the Letter of <i>de Fonte</i>, owing to the Neglect of a proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Enquiry into the Circumstances relating to it, by such an Inquiry the
Uncertainty would have been removed.</p>

<p>What hath been said is to shew that the Argument on which so great
a Stress is laid, that there is no Account of this Voyage amongst the
<i>Spanish</i> Records, is an Argument of no Weight against the Authenticity
of this Account; and that as a Publication of this Voyage was not permitted,
an Account of such Voyage could not be perpetuated by the Religious,
the only probable Means at that Time of preferring it from Oblivion.
As it was intended what was the Effect of this Expedition should
be kept a Secret, it is not consistent there should be many written Accounts
of it; the Officers concerned would be cautious of letting Transcripts
be made from their Journals; and it may be attributed to an extraordinary
Accident, rather than to what could be expected, that a
Copy of the Letter of <i>de Fonte</i> should ever come into the Possession of
the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>These Observations being previously made, we are better enabled to
consider, what we have before inserted, the Objection of <i>Venegas</i> for not
inserting this Account of <i>de Fonte</i>, as being of little Credit; but he seems
rather to wish that we would be of his Opinion, than to imagine that
he could convince us by any Arguments; therefore excuses himself as
to the Length of the Dispute he might be engaged in. His Manner of
expressing himself with respect to this Disappointment in the Secretary's
Office, shews he hath a Manner of Address that his Words will admit of
a further constructive Meaning than what is set down. The principal Object
of his Writing is to incite the Court of <i>Spain</i> to prepare in Time
against the ill Consequences of the <i>English</i> making a Discovery of a Passage;
and he is to be understood, that it is not only his Opinion that
the finding of such a Passage is practicable, but he apprehends it is of
the Opinion of the Court also. Declares, that such Opinion hath prevailed
from the first settling of <i>Mexico</i>, and that there really is a Passage
in such a Manner as a Person who published an Account of this Sort
would be permitted to express himself, to have it pass the Approbation
of the Licenser; and does not desire to suppress the Account of <i>de Fonte</i>,
as it is an absolute Contradiction to what he would infer, there being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Passage, and in such Letter it is declared there is no North-west Passage.
For he must have had further and better Authorities for his Assertions
of there being a Passage than such, as that single Assertion would prevail
against. But desired to suppress this Account, as it was an Account
which he knew it was more consistent with the Designs of the Court, it
should be continued in Oblivion than revived. Mentions it therefore as
the <i>Contents of a</i> Paper published in <i>London</i>, which contained a Narrative
of little Credit; and to give the better Authority to what he says, as he
could not trust to the Opinion that might be had of such Account on
a fair Representation of the Title; to support the Character he gave of
it, therefore uses Art, misrepresenting such Title; says it was <i>by Order of
the Viceroy of</i> Peru, <i>in the Year</i> 1640, and <i>giving an Account of the most
material Transactions and Adventures in this Voyage</i>. Was the Letter so
entituled, the <i>Transactions</i> and <i>Adventures</i> of a Commander in Chief of
the Navy, in <i>New Spain</i>, he would not be singular in his Opinion, but
it would be understood by every one as a Romance, and not deserving
of Credit.</p>

<p>This Misrepresentation is intentionally done; for if he never saw
the Letter, or had not a right Account of it, on what Authority could
he assert it was of little Credit; and that it would engage him in a
long Dispute, a Dispute which his Sagacity would point out to him
how to determine in a very few Lines, by proving that there was no
such Person as <i>de Fonte</i>, Admiral of <i>New Spain</i>; which it was in his
Power to do had it been the Case. But what he mentions is so far from
a Denial of there being such a Person Admiral of <i>New Spain</i>, that he
gives us the Name, and sets forth the Character <i>de Fonte</i> was in, in a
more proper Manner than we have it expressed in the Title of the Letter.
<i>Bartholomew de Fuentes, Commander in Chief of the Navy in New
Spain and Peru, and President of Chili</i>; and he is to be understood not
to mean that there was no such Person, but that the Narrative is not
credible as to any such Voyage having been made by Admiral <i>de Fonte</i>.</p>

<p>By a Schedule of the King of <i>Spain</i> in 1606 to the Governor of the
<i>Philippines</i>, <i>Vizcaino</i> was to be again fitted out to discover a Harbour
on the Western Coast of <i>California</i>, for the Reception of the <i>Aquapulco</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Ship; but the Death of <i>Vizcaino</i> prevented that Design being carried into
Execution; as the Court had found so many Disappointments, and such
ill Success in these Undertakings, they did not think proper to entrust it
to any other Person in the <i>Philippines</i> or <i>New Spain</i>. And <i>Venegas</i> says,
Hist of <i>Cal.</i> Vol. i. P. 180. 'During the succeeding nine Years inconsiderable
Voyages only were made to <i>California</i>, and these rather to fish
for Pearls, or procure them by Barter, than to make any Settlement,
and therefore they have been thought below any separate Account,
especially as in the subsequent Royal Commissions they are only mentioned
in general without any Circumstances.' Though Commissions
were given to go into these Parts, without any Account remaining to
whom, and on what particular Occasion; it is not to be doubted as in all
Commissions of this Nature they would be under an Obligation to make
a Report to the Court, and it is not to be understood that these Commissions
were continued for nine Years only; and therefore what hath
been said as to <i>Parmentiers</i> and the Jesuits, their having been in
these Parts, is not the least improbable. By these Commissions they
were not confined to the Gulph of <i>California</i>, is evident from Father
<i>Kino</i>, as already mentioned, giving Names in his Map to Villages, or
occasional Settlements rather, on the River <i>Santo Thome</i>: And he says,
P. 299, what made Father <i>Kino</i> desirous of discovering whether <i>California</i>
was an Island or not, 'That all the Moderns had placed it as an Island,
there being extant also some Journals of Mariners, according to which
they went round <i>California</i> through a Streight, and gave the Parts and
Places through which they passed their own Names.' It appears from
this Account they were permitted, by these Commissions, to rove about,
though not to make Settlements, induced by their private Advantage,
and the Advantage to the Government was from their Discoveries. Also
Vol. i. P. 182, he mentions, 'That a great many private Persons, from
the Coast of <i>Culiacan</i> and <i>Chametla</i>, made Trips in small Boats to the
Coast of <i>California</i>, either to fish for Pearls, or purchase them of the
<i>Indians</i>;' which is agreeable to <i>de Fonte</i>'s Account of the Master and
Mariners he procured at <i>Zalagua</i> and <i>Compostilo</i>. We may also observe
what the Missionaries say, as to the Tides at the Head of the Bay, which
still adds to the Authenticity of this Account. 'In those Parts the Tide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
shifts every six Hours; the Flood, with a frightful Impetuosity,
rises from three to seven Fathoms, overflowing the flat Country for some
Leagues, and the Ebb necessarily returns with the same dangerous
Violence.&mdash;However the Pilot went on Shore in the Pinnace, at several
Parts, in order to make a complete Drawing of it for his Chart;
was equally convinced that this Cape was the Extremity of the Gulph
of <i>California</i>, and that the Waters beyond it were those of the River
<i>Colorado</i>.' Therefore it was, from the exact Observation of the Tide
which this Pilot took so much Pains to make, an unsettled Point from
whence the Tide proceeded. Which, at the Time of <i>de Fonte</i>'s Expedition,
was said to come from the Northward, agreeable to the then prevailing
Opinion of <i>California</i> being an Island. According to the usual
Practice, though the true Cause of a Phænomena is unknown, to quote
that Phænomena that favours a System which there is a Desire to establish
as a Truth, not only in support of but to confirm such System,
as to render the Truth of it unquestionable.</p>

<p>After <i>Vizcaino</i>'s Death, and though the Court of <i>Spain</i> was disappointed
as to finding able and sufficient Persons in <i>New Spain</i> whom they could
intrust, yet Adventures were made by private Persons, at their own Expence,
both for Discovery and Settlements; yet these could not be undertaken
without the Permission of his Majesty, who had taken it into
his own Hand to grant such Commissions, and mostly required a Voyage
to <i>Old Spain</i> to attain them; and the next Expedition that was made, at
the Crown's Expence, was conducted by an Admiral from <i>Old Spain</i>,
who arrived in <i>New Spain</i> in 1643, Admiral <i>Cassanate</i>, with full Power
and Necessaries to equip a Fleet, and make Settlements in <i>California</i>;
and he sailed on such Expedition in 1644. By which it is apparent
that there were Ships at that Time in <i>New Spain</i> proper for such Expeditions.
As he came into these Parts within three Years after <i>de
Fonte</i>'s Expedition, and took the Command as Admiral of <i>New Spain</i>
when he arrived, it is to be supposed the Expedition <i>Cassanate</i> was sent
on was too fatiguing for <i>de Fonte</i>, who was therefore retired to his Government
of <i>Chili</i>. In the Year 1649 Admiral <i>Cassanate</i>, in Reward for
his Services, being after the same Manner promoted to the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of <i>Chili</i>, <i>de Fonte</i> must be dead at that Time. This Circumstance fixes
the Period in which the Copy of this Letter was taken.</p>

<p>As what <i>Venegas</i> says as to the Account (which Account hath been
before mentioned) given by <i>Seyxas y Lovera</i>, as to its wanting the necessary
Authenticity. Besides the usual Licences, wherein the Licencers
declare there is nothing contrary to good Manners, and besides being
dedicated to the King in his Royal and Supreme Council of the <i>Indies</i>,
<i>Seyxas</i>'s Book hath the Licence and Approbation of the Professor of Divinity
in the University of <i>Alcara</i>, Preacher to the King, and Principal
of a College of Jesuits in <i>Madrid</i>. Hath also the Approbation and Licence
of the Professor of Erudition and Mathematicks in the Imperial
College of the Company of the Jesuits at <i>Madrid</i>. What unfavourable
Opinion soever we may entertain of the Principles of these Persons, we
must have such an Opinion of their Prudence, that they would not sign
their Approbation to a Book while it contained an unnecessary Lie,
which could be easily expunged, or until they were satisfied as to the
Authenticity of this Account which <i>Seyxas</i> gives of <i>Peche</i>'s Voyage, having
been published in various Places. And it is indisputable from the
Countenance his Book received, he was looked on at that Time as a deserving
honest Man.</p>

<p><i>Venegas</i> designedly omits other Accounts dispersed in various Books
for Want of necessary Authenticity; but it is not to be understood that
he absolutely denies that such Accounts are true. Neither is there so
great an Improbability in such Discoveries having been made, as some
of these Accounts mention, as is imagined, when such Accounts are duly
considered.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned one Account which engaged the Attention
of the King of <i>Spain</i>, therefore must have been of some Authority.
There is another Account (unless it be the same Account differently represented)
of a Ship that, to the Northward of Cape <i>Blanco</i>, on the
Coast of <i>California</i>, passed through the Streight into the <i>North Sea</i>, and
to <i>Old Spain</i>, which was also made known to the King of <i>Spain</i>, mentioned
by <i>Torquemada</i>, Vol. i. P. 725.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>Most of the Discoveries are reported to have been made by Ships
coming from the <i>Moluccas</i>, or from the <i>Philippine</i> Islands to the Eastward,
and which have met with bad Weather. And what, in those Times,
Ships were necessitated to do, if there was a Continuance of hard Gales
of Wind, we may learn from the Schedule of <i>Philip</i> the Third, History
of <i>California</i>, Vol. i. P. 175, after mentioning a Harbour found by <i>Vizcaino</i>,
on the Western Coast of <i>California</i>, adds, 'And lies very convenient
for Ships returning from the <i>Philippine</i> Islands to put into, and
thus, in case of Storms, avoid the Necessity of making for <i>Japan</i>, as
they have several Times done, and expended great Sums of Money.
Besides, they usually have Sight of the Coast of <i>China</i>, which is an
additional Benefit, as knowing where they are, they will not as formerly,
in case of bad Weather, make for <i>Japan</i>, or those Islands, as
the same Winds which would carry them thither, bring them into this
Harbour. Again, P. 177, considering how much it concerns the Security
of Ships coming from those Islands, in a Voyage of no less than
2000 Leagues, on a wide and tempestuous Sea, that they should be
provided with a Port where they might put in and furnish themselves
with Water, Wood, and Provisions: That the said Port of <i>Monterey</i>
lies in 37 Degrees, nearly about half Way the Voyage.'</p>

<p>A Ship flying before the Wind, and the People steering her towards
the Coast of <i>America</i>, to avoid <i>Japan</i> and the Islands, making a Cape
Land on the Coast of <i>California</i>, would run for what they supposed a
Harbour, and the bad Weather continuing might proceed up the Bay
or Opening they were then in, to meet with the Inhabitants, in order
to obtain Refreshments, and to learn where they were, by which Means
find a Passage. As Ships were distressed in hard Gales of Wind, in the
Manner the Schedule mentions, there is no Improbability of a Passage
being first accidentally discovered by a single Ship coming from Sea
with a leading Wind into a large Opening, in Expectation of a Harbour,
though such Discovery hath not been made by Ships intentionally
sent along Shore for that Purpose.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, the People of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands are those who
most talked of a Passage: They informed <i>Peche</i> and others; and it is
easily accounted for why they should do so: For if the <i>Portugueze</i> made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the Discovery in a Ship from the <i>Moluccas</i>, there was a constant Intercourse
between them and the People of the <i>Philippines</i>; and whether
the Discovery was made by the <i>Spaniards</i> or <i>Portugueze</i>, some of the
Company who were aboard such Ship as had passed through the Streight
from the <i>South</i> to the <i>North Sea</i>, would return to the <i>Moluccas</i> or the
<i>Philippines</i>; and others would meet their Acquaintance from thence in
<i>Portugal</i> or <i>Old Spain</i>; who would take Pleasure in relating to them the
Accounts of their Voyage, and which they who heard those Accounts
would be equally fond of communicating to others, especially when
they returned back to the <i>Indies</i>. By which Means it would be known
that there had been such a Discovery; and it would be out of the
Power of the King of <i>Spain</i> or <i>Portugal</i> to prevent its being so far known,
but could prevent the Account of such Discovery being published, or
the Particulars communicated to Foreigners.</p>

<p>In the Year 1568 <i>Salvatierra</i>, a Gentleman of <i>Spain</i>, who had accidentally
landed in <i>Ireland</i> from the <i>West Indies</i>, gave an Account of a
Passage having been made by one <i>Andrew Urdanietta</i>, and by the Circumstances
of that Account it was about the Year 1556 or 1557. This
<i>Urdanietta</i> was a Friar, was with and greatly assisted <i>Andrew Miguel Lopez
de Legaspi</i> in the Expedition to the <i>Philippine</i> Islands in the Year
1564, and was called the celebrated Religious <i>Andrew de Urdanietta</i>.
His being thus employed, and so serviceable in this Expedition to the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, as he is said to have been, implies, that he had a
prior Knowledge of those Parts, and must have been there before; and
the Character that <i>Salvatierra</i> gave of him to Sir <i>Hugh Sydney</i>, then Lord
Deputy of <i>Ireland</i>, and Sir <i>Humphrey Gilbert</i>, was, that he was the greatest
Discoverer by Sea that was in that Age.</p>

<p><i>Salvatierra</i> said that <i>a North-west Passage</i> was constantly believed to be
in <i>America</i> navigable; and that <i>Urdanietta</i> had shewed him at <i>Mexico</i>
eight Years before <i>Salvatierra</i> arrived in <i>Ireland</i>, a Chart made from his
own Observations in a Voyage in which he came from <i>Mare del Zur</i> into
<i>Germany</i>, through this North-west Passage, wherein such Passage was expressed,
agreeing with <i>Ortelius</i>'s Map: That <i>Urdanietta</i> had told the
King of <i>Portugal</i> of it as he came there from <i>Germany</i> in his return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
home; but the King earnestly intreated him not to discover this Secret to
any Nation: <i>For that</i> (said he) <i>if</i> England <i>had once a Knowledge and
Experience of it, it would greatly hinder the King of</i> Spain <i>and me</i>. And
<i>Salvatierra</i> was himself persuaded of a Passage by the Friar <i>Urdanietta</i>,
and by the common Opinion of the <i>Spaniards</i> inhabiting <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>It was this Account with some other that gained the Attention of the
greatest Men of that Age to pursue the Discovery of a North-west Passage.
Neither would <i>Dudley</i>, <i>Walsingham</i>, or Sir <i>Humphrey Gilbert</i>, and
other honourable Persons about the Court, be deceived with fictitious
Stories, and pursue a Phantom. Could the great Abilities and Penetration
of a <i>Walsingham</i> be defective in this Respect, which was so perfect
in all other Respects, as to be the Admiration of the present Age.
Those who condemn this Account, and some other Accounts of this
Sort, have not considered, that upon a slight Surmise or Suspicion only
they put their Judgments in Competition with and in Contradiction to
the Judgments of those great Men, who embraced no Opinion as to
any Matter but what was founded in Reason, and all the Circumstances
relating to which they had first fully considered, and which Opinion
they adhered to. As to a North-west Passage, making a Distinction between
the Disappointments as to the effecting the Discovery of a Passage,
and the Probability there was of their being such Passage. The King of
<i>Spain</i> was equally successless as to the Execution, and at the same Time
as much assured of the Practicability of making it; for which Reason
Secretary <i>Walsingham</i> was concerned at his Death, as the Attention of
the Publick was drawn to a <i>North-east</i> Passage, by which nothing more
was proposed than a Trade to <i>Cathæy</i> or <i>China</i>, and that a North-west
Passage was neglected on the Part of the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>It was an Opinion received in <i>England</i> in the Year 1560, or earlier,
that there was such a Passage; and before the <i>Philippines</i> were settled
by the <i>Spaniards</i>. Soon after the Discovery of <i>Urdanietta</i>, <i>Frobisher</i>, who
set out in 1576, is said to have projected his Design, and made an Application
for fifteen Years before. Did not succeed in the City probably,
as they might not see any certain Advantage; but when he applied to
the Court he succeeded. On what Plan he went is also evident, to find
an Entrance to Northward of the <i>Labrador</i>; for when he fell in with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
the South-west Part of <i>Greenland</i>, it was supposed by him to be the <i>Labrador</i>
Coast.</p>

<p>There is another Account on the Oath of <i>Thomas Cowles</i> of <i>Bedmester</i>,
taken the 9th of <i>April</i> 1579, at a Time when Oaths were considered by
all People as solemn and sacred Obligations to declare the Truth. He
says that six Years before, he heard a <i>Portugueze</i> read a Book which he
set out six Years before in print in the <i>Portugal</i> Tongue, declaring that
he, <i>Martin Chacke</i>, had found, now twelve Years past, a Way from the
<i>Portugal Indies</i> through the Gulph of <i>Newfoundland</i>, which he thought
to be in Latitude 59° of the North Pole, by Means that he being in the
said <i>Indies</i> with four Ships of great Burthen, and he himself being in a
small Ship of eighty Ton, far driven from the Company of the other
four Ships with a West Wind; after that he had passed along by a great
Number of Islands, which were in the Gulph of the said <i>Newfoundland</i>,
and after that he overshot the Gulph, he set no more Sight on any other
Land, until he fell in with the North-west Part of <i>Ireland</i>; and from
thence he took his Course homeward, and by that Means came to <i>Lisbon</i>
four or five Weeks before the other Ships. But the Books were afterwards
called in by the King's Order.</p>

<p>This Passage was made about ten Years after that of <i>Urdanietta</i>; and
it is probable <i>Chacke</i> was encouraged to proceed through such Passage,
from the Report or an Account which he had heard of such Passage
having been before made. It is evident he met with some Difficulties
in such Passage which delayed him, as the Ships were at <i>Lisbon</i> so soon
after him, and as he expresses that he was far driven from the other
four Ships he left them in a low Latitude, and being got to the Northward,
without any Expectation of rejoining them, proceeded intentionally
to make his Voyage by the Passage; which he would not have done
to the Hazard of losing his Vessel and Cargo, for he was not on Discovery,
but returning to <i>Lisbon</i> in Company with other loaden Vessels,
from whom he was separated, unless he had been assured that what he
undertook was practicable, and a Passage had been made by some Vessel
before that Time. This Account was received as a Truth by the principal
People of the Kingdom, who certainly made a due Enquiry as to
the Character of the Person who made the Affidavit with respect to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Capacity, there would be a proper Precaution also, at the Time of administering
such Affidavit, that it was exact and only what he knew positively
as to this Matter, tho' there might be other Circumstances which he
was not so positive in. And as this Account was at that Time believed,
it must have been on better Reasons than can be at present urged by any
one to call the Veracity of this Account in Question.</p>

<p><i>Juan de Fuca</i> (the Account is from <i>Purchase</i> and <i>North-west Fox</i>) was
an ancient Pilot, who had been in the <i>West India</i> of <i>Spain</i> for near forty
Years, and had sailed as Mariner and Pilot to many Places thereof in
Service of the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p>He was Pilot of three small Ships which the <i>Viceroy</i> of <i>Mexico</i> sent
from thence, armed with a hundred Soldiers, under a <i>Spaniard</i> Captain,
to discover the Streights of <i>Anian</i> along the Coast of the <i>South Sea</i>, and
to fortify in that Streight, to resist the Passage of the <i>English</i> Nation,
but by Reason of a Mutiny which happened amongst the Soldiers, for
some ill Practices of the Captain, the Voyage was overset, and they returned
to <i>New Spain</i>.</p>

<p>The Viceroy sent <i>de Fuca</i> out again in 1592, with a small Caravel
and Pinnace, armed with Mariners only, for the Discovery of the said
Streights. Finding the Land to trend North and North-east, with a
broad Inlet between 47 and 48, he entered it, and sailing therein more
than twenty Days, found the Land trending still, sometimes North-west,
sometimes North-east, and also South-eastward, far broader Sea than at
the said Entrance; and passed by diverse Islands in that Entrance.</p>

<p>He went upon Land in several Places, and saw some People on Land,
clad in Beasts Skins; and that the Land was very fruitful, and rich of
Gold and Silver, and Pearls, and other Things like <i>Nova Hispania</i>.</p>

<p>Being entered thus far in the said Streight, and come into the <i>North
Sea</i> already, and finding the Sea wide enough every where, and to be
about thirty or forty Leagues wide in the Streight where he entered;
he thought he had well discharged his Office, and done the Thing he was
sent to do; and that he not being armed to resist the Force of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
savage People, that might happen to assault him, therefore set sail and
returned to <i>Nova Hispania</i>, where he arrived at <i>Aquapulco, Anno 1592</i>,
hoping to be well rewarded by the Viceroy for his Voyage so performed.</p>

<p>The Viceroy received him kindly, and gave him Promises; but after
an Expectation of two Years the Viceroy wished him to go to <i>Spain</i>, where
the King would reward him; and he accordingly went.</p>

<p>He was well received at Court; but after long Suit could get no Reward
to his Content, so stole away and came to <i>Italy</i>, to live amongst
his Kindred in his own Country, being very old, a <i>Greek</i> by Birth, born
in the Island of <i>Sepholonica</i>, and his proper Name <i>Apostollos Valerianos</i>.</p>

<p><i>De Fuca</i> went first to <i>Leghorn</i>, then to <i>Florence</i>, where he met one
<i>John Dowlass</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>, a famous Mariner, ready coming for <i>Venice</i>,
to be a Pilot for a <i>Venetian</i> Ship to <i>England</i>; they went in Company
to <i>Venice</i>. <i>Dowlass</i> being acquainted with Mr. <i>Lock</i>, at least a considerable
Merchant if not a Consul there; gave him an Account of this
<i>de Fuca</i>, and introduced him to Mr. <i>Lock</i>, who gave Mr. <i>Lock</i> the preceding
Account; and made a Proposal, if Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> would make
up the Loss which he had sustained aboard the <i>Aquapulco</i> Ship taken by
Captain <i>Cavendish</i>, which was to the Value of sixty Thousand Ducats, he
would go to <i>England</i>, and serve her Majesty to discover the <i>North-west
Passage</i> into the <i>South Sea</i>, and engage his Life for the Performance,
with a Ship of forty Tons and a Pinnace. They had two several Meetings
on this Occasion; and <i>Lock</i>, at <i>de Fuca</i>'s Request, wrote to the old
Lord <i>Treasurer Cecil</i>, Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i>, and Mr. <i>Richard Hackluit</i>, the
Cosmographer, desiring a Hundred Pounds for to pay his Passage to
<i>England</i>. His Friends wrote <i>Lock</i> Word, the Action was very well liked,
if the Money could be procured. As no great Expectations were to be
had from this Answer, <i>de Fuca</i> left <i>Venice</i> in a Fortnight after, pursued
his Design of going to <i>Greece</i>, and there died.</p>

<p>There is nothing in this Relation but what is very natural and simple.
<i>De Fuca</i>'s Demand was excessive, for which Reason, probably, as a Man
who over-rated his Services, he was not rewarded by the <i>Viceroy</i> or the
<i>King</i>; yet the <i>Viceroy</i> availed himself of him, by sending him to Court
to give an Account of his Voyage, which he might be ordered to do,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
as another Expedition was desired, and a Representation for that Purpose
made by the Viceroy <i>Luis Velasco</i>, as is mentioned in the Schedule
of the King. History of <i>California</i>, P. 173.</p>

<p>It did not appear that he could certainly perform what he undertook,
concluding he was in the <i>North Sea</i>, from such Sea returned back to
<i>New Spain</i>, therefore had not acquired a Knowledge of the Entrance
into the Streights from the Eastward; which was the Difficulty that obstructed
this Discovery on the Part of the <i>English</i>, and had been so much
sought after, but unsuccessfully. His Age was also a very material Objection,
that he would scarce be able to bear the Fatigue of such a Voyage,
his Desire to undertake which immediately proceeded from his
Avarice: Nor was it confident that the Hundred Pounds should be
sent over to bring him to <i>England</i>, if the other Part of the Terms could
not be complied with; which seems to be the Meaning of the Expression,
the Action is well liked of if the Money could be procured. And
<i>de Fuca</i>, whose Motive for proposing this Undertaking, was to be satisfied
for his Loss by Captain <i>Cavendish</i>, would not have altered his Design
of going into his own Country, and proceeded to <i>England</i>, unless
he was assured of his being so gratified on a Performance of what he
undertook.</p>

<p><i>Dowlass</i>, who was a good Mariner, as he travelled with him, and
kept his Company, would have had particular and frequent Conversation
with <i>de Fuca</i>, and who, as a Mariner, was more capable of finding
out if his Account was true, and was thoroughly satisfied it was so, as
he spoke to Mr. <i>Lock</i> about him. Neither <i>Lock</i> nor <i>Dowlass</i> could have
any sinister Views, but only animated by a publick Spirit to do their
Country so acceptable a Service, which it was thought to be in <i>England</i>,
as it is said the Action is well liked of.</p>

<p>As to <i>de Fuca</i> being taken Prisoner by Captain <i>Cavendish</i>, and how
did he escape out of the Hands of the <i>English</i>? When the Ship was
taken all the People were put ashore on the Coast of <i>California</i>, the
Goods were taken out, and then the Ship was set a Fire, which burnt to
the Water Mark, the Wreck floated ashore, they erected Jury-masts in
her, and fortunately got to <i>Aquapulco</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p><i>De Fuca</i> says, the Cause he thought of the ill Reward he had of the
<i>Spaniards</i> was, that they understood very well the <i>English</i> Nation had
now given over all their Voyages for the Discovery of a <i>North-west
Passage</i>, wherefore they feared not them to come any more that Way
into the <i>South Sea</i>; and therefore they needed not his Service therein any
more: Which is so far agreeable to the Accounts of those Times, that,
after the Death of Sir <i>Francis Walsingham</i>, the Discovery of a North-west
Passage had no Patron at Court; and Sir <i>Francis</i> had particularly interested
himself in procuring <i>Davis</i> to go on his last Expedition. The
Discovery was not re-assumed until the Year 1602, by the <i>Muscovy</i> Company,
who had never engaged as a Company in this Discovery; but
having made some successless Attempts, as to the North-east Passage,
fitted out Capt. <i>George Weymouth</i> for the Discovery of a North-west Passage,
which it is observable was the same Year with <i>Vizcaino</i>'s Expedition.
And it is observable the next Expedition for the Discovery of
a North-west Passage, was not until the Year 1606, when Mr. <i>John
Knight</i> was fitted out; and the same Year the King of <i>Spain</i> orders <i>Vizcaino</i>
on a third Expedition, but <i>Vizcaino</i> died, though in the interim
<i>Vizcaino</i> had been to <i>Old Spain</i>, to make Application to make a fresh
Attempt, at his own Expence, and he could not obtain Permission of
his Majesty. As the Expeditions which the Court of <i>Spain</i> order peremptorily
to be undertaken, correspond as to the Time with those from
<i>England</i>, shews a Jealousy on the Part of the King of <i>Spain</i> that the
<i>English</i> might succeed as to a Passage through the Streights. And
though it is mentioned as the principal Design in the Expeditions by
Order of the King of <i>Spain</i>, is the Discovery of a Harbour for the <i>Aquapulco</i>
Ship, the Publick understood there was yet a farther Design, and
as much may be collected from the King of <i>Spain</i>'s Schedule in 1606.
Count <i>de Monterey</i>, 'by pursuing the Discovery intended by <i>Don Luis de
Velasco</i>, wrote to me concerning, and was of Opinion that small Vessels
from the Harbour of <i>Aquapulco</i> were the fittest; and that in the
Discovery might be included the Coasts and Bays of the Gulph of <i>California</i>,
and of the Fishery, to which, in my Letter of the 27th of
<i>September</i> 1599, I ordered to be answered, that the Discovery, and
making Draughts, with Observations of that Coast, and the Bays along
it, having appeared to me <i>highly convenient</i>, it was my Will he should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
immediately put it in Execution, without troubling himself about <i>California</i>,
unless occasionally&mdash;And <i>Sebastian Vizcaino</i> carefully informed
himself of these <i>Indians</i>, and many others, whom he discovered along
the Coast for above eight Hundred Leagues; and they all told him,
that up the Country there were large Towns, Silver, and Gold;
whence he is inclined to believe that great Riches may be discovered,
especially as, in some Parts of the Land, Veins of Metal are to be seen;
and that the Time of their Summer being known, a farther Discovery
might be made of them by <i>going within</i> the Country, and that the
Remainder of it may be discovered along the Coast, as it reaches beyond
42 Degrees, the Limits specified to the said <i>Sebastian Vizcaino</i> in
his Instructions.' Though these Orders were received in <i>Mexico</i> in 1599,
no Voyage was set out on until 1602, the Time that <i>Weymouth</i> sailed,
then probably enforced by additional Orders from the Court of <i>Spain</i>.
The Expedition which was overturned by the Mutiny of the Soldiers,
seems to have been about the Time of Captain <i>Davis</i>'s Expedition; for
<i>de Fuca</i> says, after the Voyage was so ill ended, the Viceroy set him out
again in 1592, which implies a Distance of Time between the first and
second Voyage.</p>

<p>The Instructions <i>Vizcaino</i> had in the first Voyage were given by the
Viceroy, for it was the Viceroy who appointed him, and were formed
according to the Opinion that the Land beyond forty-two Degrees took
a Course to Westward and Southward of West. And the Maps were
constructed agreeable thereto, therefore the King says, '<i>Vizcaino</i> had
represented to him that the Coast, as far as 40 Degrees, lies North-west
and South-east, and that in the two other Degrees, which makes
up the 42 Degrees, it lies North and South,' and, as before mentioned,
says, 'and that the Remainder of it may be discovered along the Coasts,
as it reaches beyond 42 Degrees, the Limits specified to the said <i>Sebastian
Vizcaino</i> in his Instructions.' Therefore when <i>Martin Aguilar</i>
got to 43 Degrees and found an Opening, he concluded, as the Coast
was represented to be terminated to the Northward, by the Maps and
Charts in Use, that this must be the desired Streights; and therefore said
on their Return, 'they should have performed a great deal more, had
their Health not failed them; for it is certain that only fourteen Persons
enjoyed it at <i>Cape Blanco</i>. The General and those that were with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>him had a mind to go through the Streight, which they call of <i>Anian</i>,
and is said to be thereabouts. It had been entered by the foreign
Ship, who gave Intelligence of it to the King, describing its Situation,
and how through that Passage one might reach the <i>North Sea</i>,
and then sail back to <i>Spain</i>, along <i>Newfoundland</i> and the Islands of
<i>Baccalaos</i>, to bring an Account of the Whole to his Majesty.' <i>Torquemada</i>,
Vol. i. P. 725. But it is very plain the King had another Information
of this Matter, and as to the Extent of the Land to Northward.
<i>Luis de Velasco</i> was the Viceroy in whose Time the Expedition of <i>de Fuca</i>
was; and the Expedition of <i>Vizcaino</i> was under the Direction of the
Count <i>de Monterey</i>, who was either not informed of what had been done
by <i>de Fuca</i>, or might not think <i>de Fuca</i>'s Account of sufficient Authority
to justify him, the Viceroy, in drawing his Instructions agreeable thereto;
contrary to the general Opinion of the Cosmographers at that Time,
and the Description they gave of the Coasts in their Maps.</p>

<p>It must appear from what hath been said that there are no such great
Improbabilities in the Accounts of <i>Salvatierre</i>, <i>Chacke</i>, or <i>de Fuca</i>, as
hath been represented. It is also evident that the <i>English</i> had great Expectations
of succeeding; and the Court of <i>Spain</i> had great Apprehensions
we should meet with Success, and be enabled to attain a Passage by
the Streight of <i>Anian</i> into the <i>South Sea</i>; for which there must have been
some reasonable Foundation both on the Part of the one and the other.
The <i>English</i> were first induced to attempt the Discovery of such a Passage,
from the Accounts which they had from <i>Spain</i> of there being such
a Passage. The Court of <i>Spain</i> entertained, as hath been shewn, an
Opinion of there being such a Passage from the Time they conquered
<i>Mexico</i>; and, agreeable to what <i>Torquemada</i> says, had a certain Account
of it, or at least an Account which appeared to the King to be authentick.
What that Account really contained we do not know, nor was it
consistent that it should be made publick; therefore what is said as to
the Particulars of it are but Conjecture, and Representations upon Reports,
for which the Reporters could have no real Authority. As <i>Vizcaino</i>
regretted being prevented, by the Sickness of his People that he
could not go round the World, and have carried home to <i>Old Spain</i> his
Account of his Expedition. This firm Persuasion that he should have
accomplished his Passage to <i>Old Spain</i>, by the Streight of <i>Anian</i>, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
have been from some Information which he had received before he set
out, that such Passage was practicable: Neither is it mentioned as if he
proposed making a Discovery of it, but as of a Thing before done. It
was the Opinion of all those who were with him, that it was practicable;
which is agreeable to what <i>Salvatierra</i> informed Sir <i>Hugh Sydney</i>, and
Sir <i>Humphrey Gilbert</i>, That a <i>North-west Passage from us to</i> Cathay <i>was
constantly believed in</i> America <i>navigable</i>. <i>Vizcaino</i>, who is represented as
a Commander of great Conduct and Discretion (and which the Account
of his Voyage expresses him to have been) would not have attempted
to make a Passage thro' such Streights, to the Hazard, perhaps entire
Loss, of the King's Ships, and what he had before done rendered of no
Effect, unless he had a discretionary Power either to pass to <i>Old Spain</i>
by these Streights, or return to <i>Aquapulco</i>.</p>

<p>After the Expedition of <i>Knight</i> failed, and <i>Vizcaino</i> died, we hear of
no other Expeditions at the Expence of or by the positive Order of the
Court of <i>Spain</i> until that of Admiral <i>Cassanate</i>, who went the third Year
after the Expedition of <i>de Fonte</i>, to make a Survey of the Coast of <i>California</i>;
yet we have no Reason to conclude there were no other Expeditions,
but it is rather to be supposed that, after the <i>English</i> had proceeded
in their Discoveries as far as <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, the Court of <i>Spain</i>
thought it necessary, and found an effectual Way of keeping their Expeditions,
both in respect to their Equipment and what was done on
such Expeditions a Secret, by sending Officers from <i>Old Spain</i> to conduct
them, and as to which the Religious would not think themselves
at Liberty to make any Publication without the Permission of the
Court.</p>

<p>Having no Intercourse by Trade with those Parts, we cannot be acquainted
with what is transacted in those Parts, any further than what
the <i>Spanish</i> Writers are permitted to inform us, and the imperfect and
uncertain Intelligence of those who have been cruizing in those Seas.
The <i>Spanish</i> Nation have been particularly cautious of keeping the Knowledge
of their Coast secret: Neither was it known, in the Year 1745, that
an exact Survey was made of those Coasts until <i>Pasco Thomas</i> annexed
to his Account of Lord <i>Anson</i>'s Expedition, published in 1745, a Copy
of a Manuscript, which Manuscript contained an Account of the Latitudes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and Longitudes of all the most noted Places in the <i>South Sea</i>,
corrected from the latest Observations by <i>Manuel Monz Prieto</i>, Professor
of Arts in <i>Peru</i>, and are composed with as much Precision and Exactness,
as Tables of that Sort are usually made; but when these Coasts
were surveyed to the Northward, to attain a Knowledge of which was
formerly attended with such immense Difficulty; and to what Purpose
and what Trade is carried on there, we are at present entire Strangers
to. It is by Accident only that we have this Account; and if the <i>Spanish</i>
Nation have used this Precaution, with respect to the Knowledge of
their Coasts, undoubtedly they would use the same Caution with respect
to giving us any Insight as to how we might find a more ready Access
to such Coasts by a <i>North-west</i> Passage.</p>

<p>The Point of <i>Sueste del Estrech d'Anian</i>, inserted in such Tables, shews
the Opinion of the Streights is far from being exploded; but it is acknowledged
by the Geographers of <i>Peru</i> and <i>New Spain</i>, at the present
Time, that there are such Streights. The naming the <i>South Point</i> of the
<i>Streight</i> implies there is Land to the Northward, as to which it doth not
seem to be consistent with the Purpose of the Person who composed this
Table to take any Notice, but that there is such Land is confirmed by
the <i>Russian</i> Discoveries.</p>

<p>The Extent of <i>America</i> to Northward and Westward, that <i>America</i>
and <i>Asia</i> were contiguous and only separated by a Streight, that <i>California</i>
was an Island, that a <i>Passage</i> by the <i>North-east</i> was practicable,
have been by later <i>Geographers</i> treated as <i>Chimeras</i>, contrary to the earliest
Accounts, and the Reports of the first Discoverers, and which, by
later Accounts, the Consequence of actual Observations are found to be
true. There was a Simplicity and Honour in the People of that Age;
there was no Motive for telling the Lie, that they faithfully reported
the Discoveries they made, and if a Falshood was discovered it might
be dangerous in the Consequences; their Voyages were not lucrative
Jobs, in Hopes of a Repetition of which they formed their Accounts
accordingly. There was no particular System to support, for the Parts
they went to were entirely unknown, that a Reward and Reputation
should be procured through a prevailing Interest to such as spoke in Favour
of the System. While those to whose Fidelity and Assiduity alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
it would be owing that such Discoveries were made, though repeated
Endeavours were used to render the Undertaking ineffectual; and through
whose Means alone the Truth would be made known to the Publick;
should be ill spoken of, accused of Bribery, discountenanced, and the
whole Merit ascribed to, where it would be least deserved, and, in Truth,
where there could not be the least Pretension. Nevertheless the Reward
given would be an Instance of a generous Regard in those who had Power
to bestow of rewarding Merit, though they were inevitably deceived as
to the proper Persons to whom such Reward should have been given.</p>

<p>No Authorities have been produced from Tradition or History which
oppose the Probability of there being a North-west Passage, or the
Reality of this Account of <i>de Fonte</i>, which the more we examine the less
there appears to be of a Falsity, the Circumstances of it so consistent and
united, and there are so many extra Circumstances which concur with
that Account, that we cannot but admit to be an incontestable Truth.
We have not had a full Account of the Voyages and Expeditions of
the <i>Spaniards</i> in <i>New Spain</i>, as some of them have not been permitted
to be published. <i>Venegas</i> particularly mentions, Vol. i. P. 14, and in
other Parts, There are also Accounts of Voyages made to other Parts
of the World, which are only preserved in the Collections of the Curious,
and it is known but to few Persons that such Voyages were ever
made. There are some Voyages which are mentioned to have been made,
but cannot, after the most diligent Inquiries, be procured; yet it is no
just Objection to the Authenticity of such Voyages, or as to their not
having been made. What the first Discoverers represented as to the Extent
of <i>America</i>, its being contiguous to <i>Asia</i>, as to <i>California</i>, and as
to a North-east Passage, being in all Respects found to be true, there
is the greatest Reason to believe that there is a North-west Passage;
and it is consistent with that Precaution which the <i>Spanish</i> Nation have
made Use of, that we should not have any authentick Accounts relating to
such Passage, which they were desirous of discovering as a shorter Way to
the <i>Spice</i> Islands and the <i>Indies</i>. But when the King of <i>Portugal</i> and
<i>Spain</i> came to an Agreement as to the <i>Moluccas</i>, the principal Reason
for making such Discovery was determined, and it became their mutual
Interest that it should not be known that there was such a Passage.
Their continued Silence with respect to such Passage, implies they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
acquainted with there being such a Passage, though not to an Exactness.
It cannot imply they are dubious, when we consider the Number of Circumstances
there are already mentioned, which express the contrary.</p>

<p>There are Circumstances in <i>de Fonte</i>'s Account which shew the Inference
of there being no <i>North-west Passage</i> is not just, though just as far
as it appeared to <i>de Fonte</i>, as the River <i>Parmentiers</i> was not navigable
for Shipping. One Circumstance is, that in the River <i>Haro</i>, and Lake
<i>Velasco</i>, there were Salmon Trouts and large white Perch; also in <i>Los
Reyes</i> and Lake <i>Belle</i>, but in Lake <i>de Fonte</i> excellent Cod and Ling;
which are Fish that always abide in the Salt Water, the others come out
of the Salt Water into the fresh Waters to spawn. Which <i>de Fonte</i> would
account for that they came into the Lake <i>de Fonte</i> from the <i>North Sea</i>,
and when he passed the Streight of <i>Ronquillo</i>, supposed himself to be in
that Sea, or from the Intelligence that he obtained from <i>Shapley</i> that he
was in a Gulph or Branch of it. Another Circumstance, as it flowed in
the River <i>Los Reyes</i> twenty-two Feet, and in <i>Haro</i> twenty-four, and but
a small Tide went into Lake <i>Belle</i>, <i>de Fonte</i> concluded that the Western
Tide terminated there, and that as the Waters rose to such a Heighth at
the Entrance of those Rivers, that it was a Gulph he was in which confined
these Waters and occasioned their rise at such Entrances of the Rivers.
That the Tides in <i>Parmentiers</i>, Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, and the Streights
of <i>Ronquillo</i>, were from the <i>North Sea</i>. But by later Observations of the
Rise of the Tides, a Tide cannot proceed from <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay to that Sea
where <i>Shapley</i> was met by <i>de Fonte</i>, than through the Streights of <i>Ronquillo</i>
into the great Lake of <i>de Fonte</i>, and afterwards to rise so high in
the River <i>Parmentiers</i>. Neither can such a Tide proceed through the
broken Land to Northwards of <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights, named <i>Cumberland</i>
Isles (formerly <i>Estotland</i>) and which extend as far as Latitude 70; for it
is evident the Strength of such Tides is spent in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay and <i>Baffin</i>'s
Bay: For at the Bottom of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay it flowed but two Feet,
at the Bottom of <i>Fretum Davis</i> or <i>Baffin</i>'s Bay, but one Foot. Which
is agreeable to the Opinion of all the Discoverers of that Time,
as to the Eastern Tide from the Proportion that the great Spaces or
Seas which were to receive it bore to the Inlets by which it came in,
that the Force of such Tide must be consumed in such Seas, and therefore
expected to meet with a Tide from Westward, which counterchecked
the Eastern Tide. On the other Hand, if we consider this Tide to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
from the Western Ocean, such Tide forced through various Entrances
up a Streight as that of <i>de Fuca</i>, must enter the Sea where <i>Shapley</i> was
met, with great Impetuosity; rise in Heighth proportionable to the
Width in all Openings that there are to receive it. As it is the Tide
round <i>Greenland</i>, and that which comes from the Southward along the
Coast of <i>Labrador</i>, being both received in those Indraughts of <i>Hudson</i>'s
Streights, and the broken Lands of <i>Cumberland</i> Isles, which causes the Rise
of the Tides there. It may be supposed that the <i>North-east</i> Part of the
<i>South Sea</i>, and the Streight of <i>de Fuca</i>, received the Tides which set to
Eastward along the Western Main from <i>Beering</i>'s Streights, and the Tide
which comes from the Southward along the Coast of <i>California</i>. That
the Tide is not from the <i>Tartarian Sea</i>, in Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> is evident
from <i>Bernarda</i>'s Account, who shews there is no Communication
with that Sea and the Sea that <i>Shapley</i> was met in.</p>

<p>As to the Cod and Ling in Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, or as to Salmon, it is not
known that there are either Cod, Ling or Salmon in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay:
Neither have there been found Shoals or Banks to which the Cod could
repair; nor is it known that any Cod have been catched beyond Latitude
57; an Article to which <i>Davis</i> was particularly attentive: Therefore
it is not probable that they should come from the <i>North Sea</i> through
<i>Hudson</i>'s Bay to Lake <i>de Fonte</i>. <i>De Fonte</i> mentions Shoals in the North-east
Part of the <i>South Sea</i>, which he passed up. And in <i>Vizcaino</i>'s Voyage
there is an Account that, off the Island <i>Geronymo</i> on the Coast of
<i>California</i>, the Ships Companies supplied themselves with Cod and Ling;
which shews there are Cod and Ling in those Seas. It was reasonable for
<i>de Fonte</i> to suppose that the Cod and Ling came from the Eastward from
the <i>Baccaloos</i>, neither could he otherwise suppose, as the contrary is only
known from Observations made much later than that Time.</p>

<p><i>Fox</i> had advanced in 1635, when he published the Account of his
Voyage, that there was a free and open Communication of the Western
Ocean with <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay: Which was looked on as an incontestable Fact
until the Voyage of Captain <i>Middleton</i>. What <i>Fox</i> said was consistent
with the Opinion which all the Discoverers had of the Proximity of the
Western Ocean; who therefore judged of the Probability of their Success
in the Parts they went into, from the Course of the Tides, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
if there was no Western Tide there was no Passage. This probably prevented
that Success, as to a Discovery of a Passage, which through their
Assiduity might otherwise have been obtained, had they not paid such
a Regard to the Tides, but made a due Survey of the Inlets and Openings
of the Coast, which on their not finding that a Western Tide came
from thence they deserted, which was also the Case as to Captain <i>Moor</i>
in the Search of <i>Pistol Bay</i> as called, to Southward of Lord <i>Southwell</i>'s
Isles, there was no Western Tide; therefore a compleat Discovery of
that Part was not made.</p>

<p>It is to be considered that the Northern and Eastern Parts of <i>America</i>,
are more intermixed with Waters than the Parts to Southward are,
being a high mountainous Country. The Mountains chiefly consisting
of a brown rocky Substance, not penetrable by the melting Snows or
Spring Rains, which therefore run off into the Levels and Valleys, and
form inland Seas, great Lakes, and Inlets, which vent their Waters into
the Ocean, necessary for carrying off that great Quantity and vast Bodies
of Ice which are formed in the Winter in those Parts, not to be
dissolved, as the greater Part is which is formed to the Southward, by the
Influence of the Sun. The Northern and Westward Part of <i>America</i> is
also mountainous, and high Ridges of Mountains were seen from the
Head of <i>Wager</i> Bay on the opposite Shore of what appeared to be a
Lake; therefore there must be Lakes and Seas to Westward, Reservoirs
for the melting Snows and Rains, also some Outlet or Channel to carry
off the great Quantities of Ice also formed in those Parts; and with
which <i>Barnarda</i>'s Account is consistent, and the greatest Reservoir and
Discharge seems to be to the Northward by that North-east Part of the
<i>Tartarian Sea</i>. The Lake <i>Velasco</i>, Lake <i>Belle</i>, Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, may be
all supposed to proceed from the same Cause, the melting Snows and
Rains, receive the Ice from the Waters which run into them, which,
from the Strength of the Currents and Tides, is soon shot from the
Shores of such Lakes, broken to Pieces and carried off into some Passage
or Inlet into the <i>South Sea</i>; and such a Vent or Channel to carry
off such Bodies of Ice must necessarily be, agreeable to what is known
by Observation in other Parts. The Objection of the great Distance it
is between the Ocean and the Sea at the Back of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, and where <i>Shapley</i> was
met, will appear of no Validity when we consider the Distance between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the Streights of <i>Gibraltar</i> and the Northern Part of the <i>Black Sea</i>. Between
the Entrance of the <i>Sound</i> to the Entrance of the <i>White Sea</i>, between
which there is Communication of Waters, or very nearly so. And
from Point <i>Comfort</i> in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay to Alderman <i>Smith</i>'s Sound in <i>Baffin</i>'s
Bay, between which there is a Communication of Waters without
entering into the <i>Ocean</i> or <i>Davis</i> Streights. From Lake <i>Superior</i> to the
Streights of <i>Belle Isle</i> at the Back of <i>Newfoundland</i>, or to <i>Cape Breton</i>, is
near forty Degrees of Longitude, or equal to 390 Leagues. And Lake
<i>Superior</i> hath a Communication with <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay.</p>

<p>This great Afflux of Waters form such Meanders and Labyrinths,
as it is impossible to say whether there is a Communication of Waters,
or whether the Waters are divided by smaller or larger Tracts or Slips
of Land, without an absolute Survey. The Lands so double or fold
one within the other, that unless you get a proper Sight of such Lands
so as to distinguish this, to discover the Opening that is between them,
there is an Appearance of a Continuance of the Land, and consequently
of a Termination of the Waters. So long as the Tide Argument prevailed
it was not thought necessary to be so accurate in the Searches. A
Sight of the Land trending a Course contrary to that Course which the
Discoverers were to pursue to make a Passage, and the Tide coming
from the Eastward, rendered a Search any further in those Parts unnecessary:
and it may be owing to the great Impropriety of adopting a particular
System, more than to any other Cause, that the Discovery of a
North-west Passage was not made by those brave industrious Discoverers,
who in a Series succeeded each other from <i>Frobisher</i> to <i>James</i>
and <i>Fox</i>.</p>

<p>This seems to be certain, that there must be one great Channel, as
<i>Hudson</i>'s Streights are to Eastward, also to Westward though intricate by
which the Waters to Westward pass into the <i>South Sea</i>, and as that to
Northward, the North-east Part of the <i>Tartarian Sea</i>. We already know
there is not a Communication by <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, thro' any Inlet by which the
Waters do come in there or sufficient for that Purpose; neither round
the Head of <i>Repulse</i> Bay, for then the Current would have been met
coming from Westward. Therefore such Channel must be to Southward
and Westward, consistent with <i>de Fuca</i>'s Account of a Streight, in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
such Manner as is represented in the Map annexed. Which Account
also agreeable to that of <i>Peche</i>.</p>

<p><i>De Fuca</i> says, he sailed twenty-six Days up such Streight before he
entered the Sea; that the Streight grew wider before he entered the Sea.
If we allow him fifteen Leagues a Day, from the Entrance of such
Streights out of the <i>South Sea</i> to where he entered the Sea, by him supposed
the <i>North Sea</i>, the Distance is 390 Leagues. As he mentions that he
found it wide enough every where, this Expression shews that he did not
suppose himself in the Ocean, but in a Gulph of the Ocean. And <i>Martin
Chacke</i> expresses himself, that after he overshot the <i>Gulph</i>, he set no more
Sight on any other Land. Therefore the Distance is agreeable to that Distance
which <i>de Fuca</i> must have gone to come into that Sea where <i>de Fonte</i>
met <i>Shapley</i>; the Description that he saw both Shores, makes a Consistency
also in those Accounts. Before <i>de Fonte</i>'s Expedition, <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay had
been discovered, yet that Discovery made no Alteration as to the Accounts
of <i>de Fuca</i> and <i>Chacke</i>, as <i>Fox</i> said beyond Lat. 64, round that Land there
was incontestably a Communication with the Western Ocean. Here is
an Agreement in three Accounts, by separate Persons at a Distance of
Time, who had no Intelligence of what had been done by each other;
for <i>Chacke</i> was a <i>Portugueze</i>; and as <i>de Fuca</i> had made his Report to
the Viceroy of <i>New Spain</i> of what he had done, and what he had done
seems to be mostly accounted of by himself, therefore no Regard might
be had to it in drawing <i>de Fonte</i>'s Instructions: All which three Accounts
agree in there being a Sea to Westward of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay.</p>

<p><i>De Fuca</i> mentions he was ashore; saw Marks of Gold and Silver;
Marquisates the same which was made such an Account of after <i>Frobisher</i>'s
return from his first Voyage, and from which it may be inferred it was
a barren mountainous Country which <i>de Fuca</i> passed through. He was
afraid of the Natives, who were clad in Beast Skins; and from whose
Behaviour he must have had some Apprehension that they would cut
him off, as he mentions that he was not armed against them. <i>De Fonte</i>
is very express as to the civil Behaviour of those <i>Indians</i> he met with, so
contrary to the Character of those whom <i>de Fuca</i> saw. Therefore those
whom <i>de Fuca</i> saw were the <i>Eskemaux</i>, who frequent the mountainous
and desolate Parts, and near to the Salt Waters where they can catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Fish, also the Seal and the Whale, from which they get many Conveniencies
besides what is necessary for their Subsistance; who are mentioned
to be also on other Parts of the Coast of <i>California</i>; are represented
as a fierce and barbarous People, who hold no Treaty or Amity
with their Neighbours, who are always in Fear of them.</p>

<p>That <i>de Fonte</i> should not pass up the North-east Part of the <i>South Sea</i>,
but go through Land, must have been, that the North-east Part of the
<i>South Sea</i> was represented as a Gulph, not a Streight, from some Observations
made prior to that Expedition, as to which the Observers might
be deceived, by its taking a Southerly Course through some Inlet or
Opening obscured by Islands, or the Entrance narrow, that they concluded
it only to be some small Branch which soon terminated; having,
at the same Time, a large open Channel before them, which they finding
afterwards surrounded with Land, concluded there was no Communication
with any other Waters, but that they had seen the Extremity of
these Waters to Eastward. That these Waters took a Course through
that desert mountainous Country, until they joined with the Waters of
the Streights that <i>de Fuca</i> came up, the People of <i>Conosset</i> might not be
able to give a just Account of, as they lived so far to Northward and
Eastward. Though they, as the Natives of <i>Conibasset</i> also came occasionally
into the North-east Part of the <i>South Sea</i>; the one mostly frequented
to Northward and Eastward, the other to Northward and Westward,
as is apparent from <i>de Fonte</i>'s Account; where they had level and
fruitful Tracts, as they produced so much Maiz; a hunting Country,
as there were three Sorts of Deer; also Fish in their Waters. Whereas
the Country on the opposite Shore of the North-east Part of the <i>South
Sea</i>, as is apparent from being the Resort of the <i>Eskemaux</i>, would be
rugged, rocky, and remarkably barren, with little Intermixtures of level
and fruitful Spots. Therefore the People of <i>Conosset</i>, or <i>Conibasset</i>, would
have no Inducements to go into those Parts. May be supposed the opposite
Coast was the Limits of their Enemy's Country, with whom if they
went to War, and knew that the Waters of the North-east Part of the
<i>South Sea</i> did communicate to Southward with other Waters; yet it cannot
be imagined that they went up those Waters so far in their Enemy's
Country of so wild a Disposition, where they were always in Danger of
being surprized, as to know whether those Waters joined with the Sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
in which <i>Shapley</i> was met. Might also be jealous if the Jesuits, or <i>Parmentiers</i>,
or others who came there, were very particular in their Enquiries,
that they intended to go and reside amongst their Enemies,
which, as the Nature of <i>Indians</i> is, would cause them to be on the Reserve,
and slack in their Informations, as to those Parts.</p>

<p>That those Persons who were in those Parts before this Expedition of
<i>de Fonte</i>, got no Information of this Streight, or of the Waters, as to
the Course of them to Southward, there must be a considerable main
Land to Southward of Lake <i>Belle</i> and Lake <i>de Fonte</i>, as is expressed in
the Map, and as to the Sea to Eastward, that Part of it which was to
Southward of <i>Ronquillo</i>, no more would be apprehended of it, being
unacquainted as to the Streight, than that it was a Part of that Sea contiguous
to <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay; and it not being known at that Time but the
Tides came from the Eastward, would have no Reason to infer, from the
Sea running to Southward, that it communicated with a Streight there.</p>

<p>To take away the Improbability of what is here advanced, we should
reflect what Assurances former Discoverers gave, that had but the Season
permitted to proceed, they should certainly have made a Passage;
though when an Attempt was again made they found their Mistake;
and from Observations then made, they saw good Reason to have a different
Opinion as to the Nature of the Passage from what they had before,
and very reasonable, as their Searches were made in Parts entirely
unknown; and as to the Appearance of the Land, the Course of the
Waters, and the Set of the Tides, the most judicious might be deceived.</p>

<p>The <i>Spanish</i> Nation had not been able to make out a Passage by their
various Attempts, agreeable to the Accounts of private Persons, which
probably might give an Opportunity for the Representations of the Jesuits
to be attended to, who would urge every Argument in Behalf of
their Discovery, and endeavour to invalidate the former Accounts as to
a Passage; which by that Time, from the ill Success as to discovering a
Passage, might not be at that Time so much thought of; and as Difference
in Time produces a Change in Opinions, whatever makes for
the reigning Opinion is adopted, as every Thing that is contradictory is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
depreciated. The Arguments for the Opinion which prevailed before
for a navigable Passage might be treated as fallacious and insignificant,
and the Instructions for the Expedition of <i>de Fonte</i> might be drawn agreeable
to the Jesuits Plan, whom it is evident knew nothing of a Streight,
but considered the Land of <i>America</i> as one continued Continent to Latitude
66. And whatever Weight this Conjecture may have, it is apparent
from the Consideration of <i>de Fonte</i>'s Letter, that the Instructions
were drawn from the Information of some who had been before in those
Parts: And by whom can it be supposed more properly that the
Court received the Information which they had than from the Jesuits,
whose Understanding and Character would admit them to a free Converse
with the Minister on a less Occasion than they would now have, to
give an Account of those Parts they had been in.</p>

<p>The <i>Court</i> of <i>Spain</i> does not seem, from the Proceedings, to be of the
same Opinion with the <i>Jesuits</i>, or <i>de Fonte</i> after his return. As the Governor
of <i>Cinoloa</i> is immediately ordered to take a Survey of the Coasts
and Harbours of <i>California</i>. And the next Year Admiral <i>Cassanate</i> is sent
from <i>Old Spain</i>; and it is probable the Court was not of the Opinion of
the <i>Jesuits</i> when they gave this Information, but formed the Instructions
for <i>de Fonte</i> agreeable thereto. As the most expedient Method, at that
Time, for intercepting the People from <i>Boston</i>, was to go the Way they
gave an Account of with the Boats through Land, as the Ships might
meet with Difficulties and Delays in passing up the Streights, also ran
great Hazard; the <i>Boston</i> Ship might pass them unperceived. Whereas,
on the Plan which was pursued, if they heard by the Natives that the
<i>Boston</i> Ship had passed, and taken her Course further to Southward or
Westward, <i>de Fonte</i> would have repaired aboard his Ship, proceeded
down <i>Los Reyes</i>, and with the Diligence which he would have made Use
of, fell in with the <i>Boston</i> Ship either in such <i>North-east</i> Part of the <i>South
Sea</i>, or on the Coast of <i>California</i>, leaving Orders for <i>Barnardo</i> how to
act in this Respect on his return. From which Conduct, and the Look-out
that was kept on the Coast of <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Peru</i>, it would have
been also impossible for the <i>Boston</i> People, unacquainted with these Parts,
and not expecting such a Diligence was used to intercept them, to have
made a successful Voyage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>That there is a Sea to the Westward of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay is reported by
the <i>Indians</i>, and is represented to have Ice in it like <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay.</p>

<p>Governor <i>Dobbs</i>, in his Account of the Countries adjoining to <i>Hudson</i>'s
Bay (P. 19.) mentions from <i>Joseph le France</i>, that their Savages
reported that in the Bottom of the Northern Bay there is a Streight,
they can easily discover Land on the other Side: They had never gone
to the End of that Streight. They say there is Ice there all the Year,
which is drove by the Wind, sometimes one Way sometimes another.</p>

<p>The <i>Indians</i>, who are called <i>Northern Indians</i>, having their Habitations
to North-west of <i>Churchill</i>, mention a Sea to the Westward of them, and
which is from <i>Churchill</i> Factory in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay twenty-five Days Journey,
not a direct Course, but from the round they are obliged to
take. They speak of the <i>Eskemaux Indians</i> to Eastward of them, but
never give an Account of any other Nations to Northward or Westward
of them. Mr. <i>Scroggs</i>, who was sent out by the <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay Company
in 1722, had two Northern <i>Indians</i>, whom he carried with him, when
he was in about Lat. 62. knew the Country very well, and had a great
Desire to go home, saying they were but two or three Days Journey
from their Family. And the Northern <i>Indians</i> who were with Captain
<i>Middleton</i>, were desirous of his going near the Shore, between Lat. 62
Deg. and 64. In Lat. 63° and 14´, Captain <i>Middleton</i> put two of the
<i>Indians</i> ashore, who were desirous of returning to their own Country.
And the Author saw an <i>Indian</i>, whose Daughter had married a Northern
<i>Indian</i> and been home with her, direct his own Son to sketch out on
a Board with a burnt Stick, the Coast of that Sea, which his Son did,
and the Father afterwards took and corrected it where he said the Son
had mistook.</p>

<p>Governor <i>Dobbs</i>, in the Account mentioned P. 45, mentions, 'that
<i>Joseph le France</i> was acquainted with an <i>Indian</i>, who lived at some
Distance from <i>Nelson</i> River in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, who, about 15 Years before
that Time, went to War against a Nation living Northward on
the Western Ocean of <i>America</i>. When they went they carried their
Families with them, and hunted and fished from Place to Place for
two Winters and one Summer, having left their Country in Autumn,
and in <i>April</i> following came to the Sea Side, on the Western Coast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
where they immediately made their Canoes. At some little Distance
they saw an Island, which was about a League and a Half long when
the Tide was out, or Water fell, they had no Water betwixt them and
the Island, but when it rose it covered all the Passage betwixt them and
the Island, as high up as the Woods upon the Shore. There they
left their Wives and Children, and old Men, to conduct them home
and provide them with Provisions, by hunting and shooting for them
on the Road; and he, with thirty Warriors, went in Quest of their
Enemies the <i>Tete Plat</i>. After they parted with their Families they
came to a Streight, which they passed in their Canoes. The Sea
Coast lay almost East and West; for he said the Sun rose upon his
Right Hand, and at Noon it was almost behind him as he passed the
Streight, and always set in the Sea. After passing the Streight they
coasted along the Shore three Months, going into the Country or
Woods as they went along to hunt for Provisions. He said they saw
a great many large black Fish spouting up Water in the Sea. After
they had coasted for near three Months, they saw the Footsteps of some
Men on the Sand; then judged they were near their Enemies, quitted
their Canoes, went five Days through the Woods to the Banks of a
River, found their Enemy's Town, made an Attack, the Enemy rallied
and put them to flight.' Then proceeds, 'upon which they fled
to the Woods, and from thence made their Escape to their Canoes before
their Enemies overtook them, and after a great deal of Fatigue
got to the Streight; and, after getting over, they all died one after
the other, except this old Man, of Fatigue and Famine, leaving him
alone to travel to his own Country, which took him up about a Year's
Time.' When he reached the River <i>Sakie</i> he met his Friends again,
who relieved him.</p>

<p>The <i>Indians</i> that this antient <i>Indian</i> went to War against, (and this
<i>Indian</i> was living at <i>York Fort</i> in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay in 1746) are mentioned
to be the <i>Tete Plat</i>, or <i>Plascotez de Chicus</i>. The Part which they inhabit
is variously laid down by the Geographers; by some in Lat. 67, Long.
265 East from <i>Ferro</i>, which is the extremest Longitude that their Country
is laid down in. Mons. <i>de Lisle</i> and others place them in Lat. 63, and Long.
280 East from <i>Ferro</i>, so their true Situation is uncertain. Yet it is apparent
that they do not live near to or on the Coast of the <i>South Sea</i>, or Western
Ocean. For what <i>Joseph le France</i> in this Account, and so of all <i>Indians</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
meant by the Word Sea is any Mass or Collection of Salt Waters which
have a Tide. P. 38, in the same Work, giving an Account of the <i>Indians</i>
passing down to <i>York Fort</i>. 'The River <i>de Terre Rouge</i>, and from that
Place they descend gradually to the Sea.' By which <i>Joseph le France</i>
means <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay. Governor <i>Dobbs</i> mentioning the Western Ocean of
<i>America</i> is a Mistake, which he was led into as having a Consistency
with the System which he had adopted. These Warriors left their own
Country in Autumn, are said to have lived near <i>Port Nelson</i> or <i>York
Fort</i>, and were at the Sea Side in <i>April</i>. Their not being sooner is not
to be attributed to the Length of the Journey but to the Season of the
Year. The old <i>Indian</i> was a Year returning to his own Country; but
he was fatigued and almost famished, so labouring under a great Debility,
and had his Food to seek in whatever Manner he could procure it.
The Winter also came on soon after his return from the Enemy. They
were on the Western Side of the Land, which separates <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay
from that Sea, where they saw so great a Tide. Afterwards passed a
Streight, which Streight lay North and South. The Sea they came from
and the Sea they passed into after such Streight, laid East and West.
They continually kept the Western Shore, as that was the Side on which
their Enemy lived; and though they were so long as three Months in
their Passage, they were obliged to go every Day ashore to hunt, being
thirty in Company, required a pretty considerable Subsistance. Their
Canoes can bear no Serge or Wave when the Wind blows, therefore are
obliged to keep close to the Shore, and must go to the Bottom of each
Bay.</p>

<p>This Account agrees both with that of <i>de Fonte</i> and <i>de Fuca</i>. The Sea
they imbarked on was that at the Back of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, and the Streight
might be formed by some Island, or both the Shores approach each other,
tho' the Account is not sufficiently intelligible to make any Description of
it in the Map. <i>De Fuca</i> says the Streight grew wider when he entered
such Sea, which seems to imply it had been narrow. And the <i>Indians</i>, as
before-mentioned, said there was a Streight, and they can perceive the
Land on the other Side. <i>De Fuca</i> also mentions he went ashore, and
found the Land fruitful, and rich of Gold and Silver and Pearls, and
other Things, like <i>Nova Hispania</i>. Which shews it was a mixed Country;
for a fruitful Country and a Produce of Gold and Silver is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Description compatible with one and the same Part. The one we may
suppose the Description of the Parts nearer the Ocean, the other of the
Parts where the <i>Tete Plat</i> live: But the old <i>Indian</i> seems also to make
a Distinction; for he says they went to hunt in the Country and the
Woods. When they had passed the Streight, they came into the broader
Part of the Streight of <i>Anian</i>, which appeared to them to be a Sea. As
to the Place of their Imbarkation, they would be directed by where they
could procure Birch to make their Canoes.</p>

<p>The true Situation of the Part they went to, nor where they imbarked
is not to be determined with any Certainty; but it doth not carry the
least Probability that they went to War with a People more than a thousand
Miles distant. It is scarce probable they had ever heard the Name
of the Inhabitants of those Parts, much more so acquainted with their
Situation as to be able to form a Plan of going to conquer them. There
must have been some particular Cause for their going to War with a People
so far off; what that was it would be difficult to imagine; if it was only to
shew their Prowess, they must have had Enemies nearer home, against
whom there was a greater Probability of succeeding. Neither could it be
at that Distance, as they had one continued Scene of Fatigue until they
reached the Streights; their Hearts broken by Reason of the Disappointment,
the Heat of Summer, no venturing ashore but for a very short Time,
either for Food or Refreshment, as they expected the Conquerors to
follow them with Canoes, it would have been impossible for them to
have reached the Streight. If they had a hundred Leagues a direct
Course until they attained the Place of their Imbarkation, and by going
round the Bays, might be near twice that Distance, the Current also
against them, it would be sufficient, stout young Fellows, and full of
Blood as they were, for what they underwent to be fatal to them. It is
evident the Streight was not far from where they imbarked, and the Relation
seems to express it so, as they had such a Fatigue in attaining to
it. Allowing the <i>Tete Plat</i> to be in Long. 108 Degrees from <i>London</i>,
and the true Course was W. S. W. or E. N. E. on their return, with a
Distance of a hundred Leagues, they would alter their Latitude 114
Miles, and make 277 Miles Departure, which, with 27 Miles to a Degree,
would make the Place of their Imbarkation to be in Longitude
98 from <i>London</i>, about the Longitude of <i>Ronquillo</i>. As to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Latitude where the <i>Tete Plat Indians</i> live, and as to the Longitude it
is but conjecture; there is such a Discordancy and Contradiction in
the Maps, there is such Uncertainty, that the North-west and West
Parts beyond <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay in the Latitude of <i>Churchill</i>, seem to be
entirely unknown. But this is to be observed, and which has been
my Direction in these Observations, the <i>Northern Indians</i> and the <i>Home
Indians</i> about the Factory of <i>York</i> Fort, mention these <i>Tete Plat Indians</i>,
and speak of them as their Enemies, therefore they cannot be at so great
a Distance as the Western Ocean, neither further than where I have supposed
their Country to be. For as the Time the <i>Indians</i> were going
there three Months, that is not to be considered so much with respect
to the Distance, as they would choose a proper Season, when there were
the fewest <i>Indians</i> in the Towns, and were mostly engaged abroad in their
Summer hunting. Perhaps there are no People who plan better in the
Partizan Way, and execute with more Success. They fix the Time they
intend to make their Attack before they set out, then proceed easily and
gradually towards their Enemy's Country, allowing a Sufficiency of
Time in which they may recover any Accident by which they might be
delayed, as unseasonable Weather, Difficulty and Disappointments as to
procuring Subsistance, or any Indisposition, that they go to Action in
their full Strength and Vigour; as an <i>Indian</i> who conducts an Expedition
would be as much contemned for Want of Prudence, on his Return
to the Towns, as he would for his Want of Conduct in leading his
People to an Attack, and when the Enemy was too powerful not bringing
them off without the Loss of a Scalp. In either of which Cases the
young People, who observe freely the most exact Discipline, and implicitly
obey what he orders, would not go any more to War with him.</p>

<p>Which Way the <i>Boston</i> Ship made this Passage is uncertain. <i>Gibbons</i>
was acquainted with <i>Bylot</i>, was Shipmate with him in Sir <i>Thomas Button</i>'s
Voyage. <i>Bylot</i> was also with <i>Gibbons</i> the Time he lost his Season, by
being detained in the Ice. <i>Bylot</i> made an Expedition for Discovery of
a Passage in the Year 1615, on Sir <i>Thomas Button</i> having at a Trial of
a Tide off the Island of <i>Nottingham</i>, in <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights, found it came
from the North-west, and to be from an Opening at the Back of <i>Cary</i>'s
<i>Swans-nest</i>, this Tide he went in Pursuit of; and was as far up as Lat.
65 Deg. 26 Min. then supposed where he was was nothing but a Bay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
but could not (he had gone up the East) return down the West Shore.
Whether <i>Gibbons</i> took his Information from <i>Bylot</i>, and pursued his Plan,
is uncertain, and found his Way round the Head of <i>Repulse</i> Bay. He
was also acquainted with what <i>Fox</i> had done, who went into Lat. 66 Deg.
5 Min. so further than <i>Bylot</i>, who did not return down the Western
Shore; but his People being indisposed, and not finding a North-west
Tide, he hastened home. These Parts, therefore, were not properly
searched, the Conclusion drawn for there not being a Passage there,
being that the Tide came from the Eastward.</p>

<p>Or whether <i>Gibbons</i> went through <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay is equally uncertain.
The undiscovered Parts of which Bay, or the Openings that were not determined
in the Expedition in the Year 1747, are in a Map hereto annexed.
But the Termination of <i>Chesterfield</i>'s or <i>Bowden</i>'s Inlet hath been
since searched by the Direction of the <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay Company, and a
Plan made of it, which I have not seen. Their Design was to go as far
up such Inlet until it terminated, or there was a Passage into another
Water. But as it is terminated by Land, and if there is no Inlet or
Opening left on the North or South Shore unsearched, or a Survey
taken from the Heights, by which they could be satisfied there was
no Communication with any other Waters by which there could be a
Passage, it is to be concluded that <i>Chesterfield</i> Inlet is no Streight or Passage
as was expected, and it appeared to be as far as the <i>Californias</i>
Boat went up, according to the Report made at that Time. The People
who had been in the Boat belonging to the <i>California</i>, when the Ship
was going up <i>Wager</i> Bay, where, from the Depth of the Water, the
Breadth between both Shores, the high mountainous Land, there was
great Reason to believe there was a Streight or Passage: Those People
declared, if there was a Streight they were assured that <i>Chesterfield</i> Inlet
was a Streight also.</p>

<p>There remains then to be searched for the Discovery of a Passage, the
Opening called <i>Pistol Bay</i>, in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay. That Part which <i>Bylot</i> and
<i>Fox</i> left undetermined, along the Coast to Southward of <i>Baffins</i> Bay called
<i>Cumberland</i> Isles, which entirely consists of large Inlets and broken
Lands. We may be too premature in our Conclusions as to the Impracticability
of such a Passage from the high Latitude and the Shortness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of the Season, as we have the Instance of the <i>Boston</i> Ship, which was
so far advanced in the Sea to Westward of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay in the Month of
<i>August</i>; and some Time would be taken up in finding out the Way.
The strong Tides that set in, and the Current when to Westward, which
there is apparently in the other Sea, may give an Expedition that may
compensate against the Shortness of the Season. It is but a short Time
that would be required to pass that Part of the Passage which lies in
those high Latitudes, as the Course would be soon altered to the
Southward.</p>

<i>OF</i>
HUDSONS BAY.
By Cap<sup>t</sup>. Smith in
1746 &amp; 1747.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Seyxas y Lovera</i>, in his <i>Theatro Naval Hydrographico</i>, in the seventh
Chapter, P. 426, says, 'North-east of <i>America</i> there is the Coast of
<i>Greenland</i>, from sixty to sixty-eight Degrees, where there is to the East
the Entrance of the Streight of <i>Frobisher</i>. North-west in the different
Islands which compose the Northern Parts of <i>America</i>, there is the
Entrance of the Streight of <i>Hudson</i>, where the <i>North Sea</i> communicates
with the <i>South Sea</i>, passing out of the Entrance of the Streight
of <i>Anian</i>, which runs North-east and South-west to the Northward of
the Island of <i>California</i>, which Streight is hid by great Gulphs on
the Part that is North of <i>America</i>, which contain such great Islands,
as <i>Cumberland</i> (or <i>Estoliland</i>) that are more than one hundred Leagues
in Length from North-east to South-west, and their Extremity from
East to West more than seventy Leagues.'&mdash;Page 44. 'Some hold it
for certain that you can sail from <i>Spain</i> to <i>China</i> through those Streights,
or to <i>Japan</i>, or to the Lands of <i>Eso</i>, in three Months. As says also
Doctor <i>Pedro de Syria</i>; but it is the Opinion of <i>D. T. V. Y.</i> Author of
the History of the <i>Imperial</i> States of the World, that he holds it for
uncertain whether there is such Streight by which you can pass from
the <i>North</i> to the <i>South Sea</i>.&mdash;P. 45. There were some of the Subjects
of the King of <i>France</i>, who offered themselves, if they could get his
Majesty's Licence, to perform that Voyage in four Months; entering
the <i>Canal de Hudson</i> from out of the Ocean, with a Course North-west
or West North-west, taking always a Sight of the Coast at Noon, they
should attain to the Height of the <i>Arctic</i> Circle, or one Degree more,
as in making that Voyage they will be favoured in that Part by the
Currents and Winds from the East and South-east, and afterwards in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
their Passage by the Streight of <i>Anian</i>, the Winds and Currents would
be from the North.&mdash;It is said that some Strangers (on what Occasion
is not said) have gone that Rout; and that there is in the Archives
of the Admiralty of <i>Lisbon</i>, and of the <i>Contratacion at Seville</i>, a
Copy of such Rout; what I here observe is the same with what <i>Don
Francisco de San Millan</i> observes, from which or from the Copy of
which Rout to be seen in various Languages, or the Disposition of the
said Streights, he holds it for certain that there is such a Course, and
relates, That a <i>Hollander</i>, on the Evidence of a <i>Spaniard</i> who was
aboard his Ship, from the North of <i>California</i>, forced by the Winds
from South-west, attained to sixty-six Degrees North-east, afterwards
took a Course East, and East South-east, came into fifty-eight
Degrees, when he entered the <i>North Sea</i> to Northward of <i>Terra Nova</i>,
from thence to <i>Scotland</i>, and from <i>Scotland</i> to <i>Lisbon</i>, in less than three
Months from the Port of <i>Nativadad</i> to <i>Lisbon</i>, of which Voyage he
makes no Doubt.' And <i>Seyxas</i> observes, he hath seen many other
Accounts of Voyages made from <i>Holland</i>, also from <i>England</i>, to the
<i>South Sea</i> in three or four Months, which he much doubts, from the
Shortness of the Time; also as in the <i>Spanish</i> Historians they have an
Account of what passes in the several Parts of the <i>South Sea</i>, in <i>Cathay</i>,
and <i>China</i>, and no such Thing is to be found in the <i>Bibliotheca</i> of the
Licentiate <i>Antonio de Leon</i>, which sets forth all the Discoveries and
Voyages which have been made from any Region from the Year 1200
in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>It is plain from the Account of <i>Seyxas</i>, he doth not determine absolutely
for a Passage, but that there is a Passage is his Opinion. His chief
Objection is to the Accounts from the Brevity of the Time in which the
Voyages were said to be performed, and there being no Account in a
careful Writer of the Discoveries made in those Parts. He doth not
confine the Passage to <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, as I understand him, but to the
Streight and the other Openings to Northward through <i>Cumberland</i> Isles,
and that they go up into as high a Latitude as the <i>Arctic</i> Circle. Which
is agreeable to <i>Acosta</i>'s Account, and gives a further Explanation to his
Meaning than I have already done. As to which Isles, and to the Northward
and Eastward of <i>Cary</i>'s <i>Swans-nest</i>, it is apparent, from the Perusal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
of the Voyages, there hath been no certain Account on a compleat
Discovery as to those Parts. What he says as to the Voyage of the <i>Hollander</i>,
it must be observed it was while <i>Holland</i> was under the <i>Spanish</i>
Government in the Reign of <i>Philip</i> the Second, and seems to be the
same Voyage, of which Mention hath been made that an Account was
found amongst the Papers of that Prince.</p>

<p>It hath been shewn to have been the constant Opinion of there being
a North-west Passage, from the Time soon after which the <i>South Sea</i> was
discovered near the Western Part of <i>America</i>, and that this Opinion was
adopted by the greatest Men not only in the Time they lived, but whose
Eminence and great Abilities are revered by the present Age. That
there is a Sea to Westward of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, there hath been given the
concurrent Testimony of <i>Indians</i>; and of Navigators and <i>Indians</i> that
there is a Streight which unites such Sea with the Western Ocean. The
Voyage which lead us into these Considerations, hath so many Circumstances
relating to it, which, now they have been considered, shew the
greatest Probability of its being authentick; which carry with them as
much the Evidence of a Fact, afford as great a Degree of Credibility as
we have for any Transaction done a long Time since, which hath not
been of a publick Nature and transacted in the Face of the World, so
as to fall under the Notice of every one, though under the Disadvantage
that the Intent on one Part must have been to have it concealed
and buried in Oblivion. Transacted also by Persons in a private Part
of the World, who only spoke of it amongst their Friends at home,
being themselves Strangers to what they had effected, and made little
Account of their Voyage. Besides the Chagrin of their Disappointment,
and the illnatured Reflections it might subject them to, they might think
it also best not to communicate it to the Publick, as it might encourage
others to the like Undertaking, and so they fall into the Hands of the
<i>Spaniards</i>, not only at the Hazard of their Ship, but their Lives, or at
least subject them to many Hardships such as they had sustained to no
Purpose. Therefore they thought proper to say little about their Discovery,
as it might only be a Means of entrapping some brave Adventurers,
who might be animated by their Example to a like Undertaking.
These would be and were, by its being so little published on their Parts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
(and no Accounts of it in <i>England</i>, which shews their Friends were under
an Injunction not to make it publick) the Resolutions of such sensible
and sagacious Men as <i>Gibbons</i> and <i>Shapley</i> were agreeable to which they
acted. All which Circumstances considered, what Degree of Evidence
can be required more than hath been given to authenticate this Account
of <i>de Fonte</i>?</p>

<p>Those who argue against a North-west Passage have no better Foundation
for their Arguments, Than that there is no Tide from Westward.
Which is arguing only for the Truth of a System, and hath
nothing to do with the Reality of a Passage, and in all Probability hath
been the principal Occasion that a Passage hath not been compleated:
For a different Course of the Land, and no Tide from Westward, concluded
any further Searches in such Part, but on a due Survey made of
the Map, as the Tide will enter up the Streight of <i>de Fuca</i>, and probably
other contiguous Entrances which are not yet known, besides the
North-east Branch of the <i>South Sea</i>, which we suppose to join with such
Streight; the Tide would fill that Sea on the Back of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, and
the Openings but be checked to the Northward by the Current; and
may be hindered from coming into <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay through the Inlet from
Causes not known, or there being great Indraughts on the opposite
Shore, which may take off the Force of the Tide, and cause it to come
but a small Way up such Inlet. There is Reason to believe the proper
Passage is up the Streight of <i>de Fuca</i>, therefore that is the proper
Streight of <i>Anian</i>, as <i>de Fonte</i> proceeded no further than <i>Los Reyes</i>, and
declared there was no North-west Passage; but the North-east Part of
the <i>South Sea</i> hath a Communication, as is expressed in the Map, in
describing which a Certainty cannot be expected, or an Exactness but
what may be contradicted if a Discovery be made. The Design of the
Map, besides what relates to the Expedition of <i>de Fonte</i>, is to shew there
is a Streight, called the Streight of <i>de Fuca</i>. A Sea at the Head of that
Streight, at the Back of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, from which Sea there is a Passage
either by an Inlet into <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, or by a Streight at the Head of
<i>Repulse</i> Bay, and so to Northward of <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay; from which Streight
there is a Passage into the <i>North Sea</i>, either to Eastward of the Land of
<i>Cary</i>'s <i>Swans-nest</i> into <i>Hudson</i>'s Streight, or by <i>Cumberland</i> Isles, and expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
in the Map in the Manner that the respective Accounts represent,
according to our Understanding of them, with a Submission to Correction
and superior Judgment. But an absolute Contradiction without invalidating
the Accounts on which such Map is constructed, or to say there
is no North-west Passage, which it is impossible should be determined
until a Search is made in the Parts which remain to be searched, are no
Objections, are only Opinions, without any Authority to support them,
which Time must rectify.</p>

<p>To make an Expedition to discover whether there is a Passage by those
Parts which remain unsearched, purposely from <i>England</i>, is what I think
an honest, disinterested, or impartial Person cannot recommend, as such
Expeditions might be repeated with great Expence, and the Event uncertain.
The Government gave their Assistance, and the Generosity of
the Merchants hath been sufficiently experienced, both in <i>England</i> and
<i>America</i>: Therefore it becomes every one whose Intention it is solely
that such a beneficial Service should be done to avoid proposing what,
might, in the Consequence, be an unnecessary Expence to Government,
and abuse the Generosity of the Merchants.</p>

<p>The Ships which went on these Expeditions, after they left the <i>Orkneys</i>,
had no Place to put into, neither could they there Wood or Water,
or conveniently repair a Damage. If they met with a Delay in passing
<i>Hudson</i>'s Streights, they were obliged, from the small Part of the
Season that was remaining, to go to the <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay Factories to winter;
that they might have the more Time the next Year; were obliged to
go to the Factories earlier than they were necessitated on Account of the
Weather, in order to get their Ships laid up, and every other Convenience
for wintering prepared before that the Winter set in. The <i>Hudson</i>'s
Bay Company, jealous of a Design to interfere with their Trade,
probably their Fears not ill grounded, the Consequence was, there was
no Cordiality between the Factors and the Captains. The Ships People,
by wintering, suffered in their Health, great Wages going on, a Consumption
of Provisions, a Spirit of Discontent and Opposition amongst the
inferior Officers, which obstructed the Success of the next Summer. To
obviate all which in any future Proceedings, a Discovery was undertaken
on the Coast of <i>Labrador</i>, to find Harbours on that Coast which Ships;
could repair to if necessary on their Voyage out, or to repair to on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
return, which they could be at sooner than at the Factories, stay longer
on Discovery, and return the same Year to <i>England</i>. How well this Attempt
answered the Design, may be collected from the Extract from a
Journal of a Voyage hereunto annexed, performed in the Year 1753,
giving an Account of the Coast of <i>Labrador</i>. As what is now to be
done in the Discovery of a Passage in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay may be effected in a
Summer, and if there is the desired Success, an Inlet found by which
there is a Passage into the Sea adjacent out of that Bay, the Vessel
which makes such Discovery, and all Ships at their return by such
Inlet, will have no Occasion to go to the Southern Part of the Bay,
it will be out of their Course, but proceed through the Streights to
<i>Labrador</i>, there Wood and Water, get fresh Fish, and other Refreshments;
can repair any Damage either as to their Masts, or their Hull,
and return the same Year to <i>England</i> by the common Tract of the <i>Newfoundland</i>
Ships, and not to go to the <i>Orkneys</i>.</p>

<p>That there was a good fishing Bank, a Coast convenient for carrying
on a Fishery, a Fur Trade, also for Whalebone and Oil with the <i>Eskemaux
Indians</i>, was a Discovery the Consequence of that Attempt from <i>America</i>.
To take the Benefit of which Discovery seems now to be the Intention
of the Publick. And a Survey of such Coast being ordered to be made
by the Government, if such Survey is extended so far as to those Parts,
in which as already mentioned such Passage must be, and without it is
so far extended, the Design of attaining a true Geographical Account of
the Northern Coasts of <i>America</i> would be incompleat. By this Means
it must be known whether there is such a Passage, the Probability of
which is unquestionable. Also by such Survey a better Account will be
got which Way the Whales take their Courses, and consequently where
it is best to go in Pursuit of them. Also as to those <i>Eskemaux</i> who frequent
to Northward of <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights, where they retire to, and a
proper Place be found to keep a Fair with them. As these <i>Eskemaux</i> as
well as those on <i>Greenland</i> Side, who have not come into those Parts any
long Duration of Time, being the same Kind of <i>Indians</i> with those in the
<i>South Sea</i>, and as they transport themselves and Families from one Part
to another by Water, it seems highly probable that it is by such a Passage
or Streight that they have got so far to Eastward. This Discovery of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Passage can be made without any additional Expence, wove in with
other Services, as was in the Discoveries which were ordered to be made
by the King of <i>Spain</i> on the Coasts of <i>California</i>. The Propriety of a
Vessel to make such a Survey, and the Abilities and Fidelity of the
Persons will be undoubtedly taken Care for. The Run from <i>Labrador</i>,
let it be from any Harbour, will be but small to any where,
where it is necessary to make the Survey. The Persons sent will go fresh
out of Harbour, whereas, with a Run from the <i>Orkneys</i>, the People are
fatigued; will now be refreshed as if they had not come from <i>Europe</i>.
Will be out from such Harbour but a few Weeks, in a fine Season of the
Year, no Way debilitated by the Scurvy, and in a few Summers will be
enabled to compleat their Survey of that Coast; using such an Assiduity
as they proceed as not to leave any Part on Supposition or Trust, but
being assured where any Inlet or Opening determines. A Person who
understands <i>Eskemaux</i>, and one or more <i>Eskemaux</i> to be procured,
would be of Service as Pilots, and to give an Account of the adjacent
Country. And there is no Vessel (it is mentioned as perhaps it is not
so very well known) so proper and serviceable for this long-shore Work
as a Marble-head Schooner, about sixty Tons, fortified as to the Ice, and
would be at all Times a useful Tender, and a proper Boat if necessary
to be left at the <i>Labrador</i>. What would give due Force to such Expeditions,
would be the Commodore of the Man of War being so near,
under whose Eye the Whole would be done, who would direct their fitting
out, receive their Report on their return, order a Review if necessary,
and be the Occasion of that due Subordination and Obedience both
of Officers and Men, which it is often very difficult to effect on such
Voyages. Merit will then be distinguished, and the Credulity of the
Persons at home will not be imposed on, and no Discouragement of those
who distinguish themselves in the Execution of such laudable Attempts.
Such a Passage being discovered, and the Sea entered to Westward of
<i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, the Manner of proceeding afterwards must be left to superior
Judgment.</p>

<p class="center">AN<br />
<big>ACCOUNT</big><br />
<small>Of Part of the Coast and Inland Part of</small><br />
<big>THE LABRADOR:</big><br />
<small>BEING</small><br />
An EXTRACT from a Journal of a Voyage made
from <i>Philadelphia</i> in 1753.</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Coast of <i>Labrador</i> to Northward of the Latitude of 57 Deg. 30
Min. is represented by Captain <i>Benjamin Gillam</i> (an Extract of
whose Journal the Author had) as a perilous Coast, and without any Inlets;
therefore the Design was to fall in with the Land to Southward of
that Latitude, which was attempted <i>August</i> the 2d; a thick Fog, but
expected when more in with the Land to have clear Weather. They
saw Ice at times the whole Day, and in the Evening found themselves
imbayed in a Body of Ice, and plainly perceiving Points of Rocks
amongst the Ice, stood out again during the whole Night for a clear Sea,
which they fortunately obtained the next Morning.</p>

<p>It was then proposed to stand yet more Southward, to make the Land
in Latitude 56°, and search the Inlet of <i>Davis</i>. From the 3d to the 9th
had various Weather, the Air temperate, Calms and light Winds, thick
Fogs for some Days, the latter Part of the Time haizey, with Rain,
which was succeeded the 10th of <i>August</i> with a hard Gale of Wind that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
moderated on the 11th, and clear Weather: Saw Rockweed, some Kelp,
Land Birds, a Number of large Islands of Ice, but no flat Ice; concluded
in the Afternoon that they saw the Looming of the Land in Lat.
56 Deg. 2 Min. Long. 56 Deg. 42 Min. at Eight at Night had Soundings
95 Fathom, at Ten at Night 80 Fathom.</p>

<p><i>August</i> the 12th, fine pleasant Weather; at Eight o'Clock had 40 Fathom
Soundings, and at Ten made the Land, bearing W. by S. ten
Leagues. Many Islands of Ice, but the Wind contrary for <i>Davis</i>'s
Inlet, stood towards another Opening which promised a good Harbour;
but not being able to attain it before Night, stood on and off until
the next Morning, fine pleasant Weather; and <i>August</i> the 13th, by
Four in the Morning, were in with the Land. A Whaleboat, with proper
Hands, was sent to sound a-head, and find a Harbour. Soon after
a Cry was heard from an Island to Northward; there appeared to be
five Persons. Some Rings, Knives, Scissors, and Iron Hoop, being taken
by the People into the Boat, after rowing about a League they entered
into a small Harbour, near the Place where the five Persons were first
seen, but who had retired. Entering the Harbour they saw Shallops
built after the <i>Newfoundland</i> Manner, at Anchor, with Buoys and Cables,
a Mast, a square Yard athwart, with a Sail bent, a Tilt made of
Seal Skins abaft. These Boats were tarred, that Summer's Work. Upon
the Sight of these Boats a Doubt arose whether they were <i>Indians</i> whom
they had seen, or some unfortunate Shipwrecked People.</p>

<p>When the Boat got further into the Harbour two <i>Eskemaux Indians</i>
came off, the one a Man in Years, the other a young Man. The elder
Man had a small black Beard. The elder Man being presented with a
Ring, immediately put it on his Finger; the young Man did the same
when one was presented him. Both declined accepting Pieces of Iron
Hoop, a very agreeable Present to the <i>Eskemaux</i> on the Western Side
<i>Hudson</i>'s Bay. They knew what Fire-arms were, which they saw in the
Boat: Also asked for some Pork, which they saw, and had been taken
into the Boat for Fear the Schooner and the Boat should be separated;
and, on the Boatsmen not having a Knife immediately ready, they produced
a Knife apiece; and the elder Man used the Word <i>Capitaine</i> in
his Address; had a Complaisance in his Behaviour. From these Circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
it was plain they carried on a Trade with the <i>French</i>; tho'
the latest <i>French</i> Authors represented them as a savage People, who would
never have any Commerce with them. And a Motive for this Undertaking
was from an Opinion, that no Trade had been carried on in these
Parts, either by <i>Europeans</i> or <i>Americans</i>, the printed Accounts and common
Report both agreed in this. It was apparent to whom these Boats
belonged; and there were more than twenty <i>Eskemaux</i> ashore, of various
Sexes and Ages, who kept shaking of old Cloaths for Sale; and
the elder Man pressed the People in the Boat very much to come ashore,
also to bring the Schooner to an Anchor, which was standing on and
off; but as the Day advanced, the Situation the Schooner was in, being
many small Islands about, and a fine Opening which promised a good
Harbour in the main Land, they declined the Invitation; and there was
an <i>Eskemaux</i> ready with a large Coil of Whalebone, seemingly for the
Boat to warp in to a small Cove and make fast with. These Civilities
were acknowledged by a Present being sent to those ashore, and after
shewing where they intended for, the Boat returned aboard the Schooner.</p>

<p>The People on board the Schooner, as they advanced towards the
Inlet where they expected a Harbour, hoisted their Ensign, which was
very large, and fired two Swivels by way of Salute; soon after the <i>Eskemaux</i>
displayed on the Rocks a large white Ensign, on a high Pole;
and when there was Occasion to lower the Schooner's Colours, the <i>Eskemaux</i>
lowered theirs; the Schooner's Colours being again hoisted, they
hoisted theirs; but a Squall of Sleet and Rain came on, which prevented
their having a further Sight of each other. At Six in the Evening the
Schooner was anchored in a convenient Harbour, a level Shore, with
high rocky Land, bare in Spots, the other Parts covered with a good
Herbage and large Groves of Trees, Firs, Spruce, and Pine. An Evening
Gun was fired to give the Natives Notice where the Schooner was,
and also a good Watch was set.</p>

<p><i>August</i> the 14th, at Day, they fired a Swivel aboard the Schooner,
and displayed their Colours as a Signal for Trade; and a Party went
ashore to ascend the Heighths. The largest Trees did not exceed ten
Inches Diameter, and fifty Feet in Heighth; many Runs of excellent
Water, Ponds in level Spots; the Country had an agreeable Aspect, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
plentiful Herbage, the Flowers were now blown, the Berries not ripened,
and the <i>Angelica</i>, of which there was great Quantity, not seeded. They
had a very laborious Walk before they attained the desired Summit;
the Musquetoes very troublesome. Being on an extraordinary Eminence
they saw the North and South Point of the main Land, or two Capes
which form a Bay, the Northermost was computed to be something to
the Northward of Latitude 56, and the Southermost in Latitude 55.
The Shore high and bold, to Northward a Number of Reefs of Rocks
lying out a great Way into the Sea, in the Southern Part of the Bay
many Islands and two Inlets. Sixty Islands of Ice of large Dimensions
in Sight. In the ascending this Heighth, saw many Moose Deer Paths,
Tracts of other Animals; and in the Ponds Trouts of about ten Inches
in Length. On the Shores few Fowl but Ducks, and a Plenty of Muscles.
The Weather very warm and pleasant. The Schooner's People found a
Barrel, a Hogshead Stave, and a Piece of hewed Wood, on which it was
conjectured that this was no unfrequented Harbour.</p>

<p>The next Morning, the 15th of <i>August</i>, the Boat was sent to carry
two Persons to the Head of the Harbour, that they might travel to a
Mountain about ten Miles off, to take a View of the inland Part of the
Country. When the Boat returned, the People brought Word they had
seen the Ruins of a Timber House. The Boat was again manned to go
and take a Survey of it; and it appeared to have been a House built
for some Persons to winter in, of Logs joined together, part standing,
with a Chimney of Brick and Stone entire. The House consisted of
three Rooms, a Log Tent near, and a Pit dug in which they seemed to
have buried their Beer. The Ground cleared at a Distance round: The
Woods burnt, several Hogsheads and Barrels, and seemingly a great
Waste of Biscuit, Pork, Salt Fish, and other Provisions, which seemed
as if those who had been here had retired with great Precipitation;
neither had been long gone, as there were fresh Feet Marks on the
Strand, and some Trees lately hewn. The Marks on the Cask shewed
that the People were from <i>London</i>; and it was supposed that as the <i>Eskemaux</i>
had not come to trade, there had been a Fray between the <i>Eskemaux</i>
and these People; and when they considered the compleat Manner
in which the Boats were equipped and rigged, doubted whether the
<i>Eskemaux</i> had not overpowered them, and had some of the People with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
them. The great Earnestness with which the elder of the <i>Eskemaux</i> made
Signs for the People in the Boat to go ashore, seemed to be with
a particular Design: Therefore it was thought prudent to be very careful
in the Watch at Night, to strike the Bell every half Hour, to keep
a continual Walk on Deck, and call <i>All is well</i>, that the <i>Eskemaux</i>
might hear, if they should intend a Surprize, that the People aboard
were on their Guard.</p>

<p>The Morning of the 16th they run up to the Head of the Harbour
with the Schooner, to Wood and Water, there being Plenty of Wood
ready cut, and a Place conveniently dammed up to confine a fine Stream
of excellent Water which came from the Heighths. There was then
found several Pieces of printed Books, in <i>German</i> and <i>English</i>, the <i>English
Moravian</i> Hymns. Peas, Beans, Turnips, and Radishes planted,
which seemed as if they would come to no great Perfection, and judged
to have been sowed about three Weeks. The wooding and watering was
finished by Ten at Night, but with no small Trouble on Account of the
Musquetoes, though great Smoaks made to keep them off.</p>

<p>The two Persons who had been sent to view the inland Country returned
in the Morning, after having spent a rainy Night in the Woods;
gave an Account that they had been forced to go round several small
Lakes, which made the Way longer than expected; and the Mountain
was very steep and rugged: Saw several large Spots of excellent Meadow:
The Timber much the same as that on the Shores of the Harbour:
That they saw two Inlets to Northward, extending a great Way
into the Land: That it was only the Branch of an Inlet that the Vessel
was at Anchor in; but they saw the Termination of the Inlet to be in
large Ponds.</p>

<p>The 17th of <i>August</i> the Schooner was to return to her first Anchorage,
with an Intention to search the Inlets to Northward; but the Wind
proved contrary, and a hard Gale, though the Weather pleasant. The
18th the Wind moderated, and the Schooner returned to her former
Anchorage; but the Wind did not serve to quit the Harbour until the
19th in the Afternoon; the Interval of Time had been filled up in brewing
Spruce Beer, and doing other necessary Work with respect to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Sails and Rigging. At Six in the Evening was close in with the Island,
where they had seen the <i>Eskemaux</i>, but now gone. It was not until the
21st, by reason of Calms and Currents, that they attained to the Inlet
to Northward. Those who had been sent out with the Boat to sound
a-head, had seen on the Shore an <i>Eskemaux</i> Encampment, from which
they were but very lately retired, and brought from thence a Piece of a
Jawbone of a Spermaceti Whale, which was cut with a Hatchet. It was
plain from that the <i>Eskemaux</i> were supplied with Iron Tools: They also
found a Piece of an Earthen Jar. They judged there had been about
eleven Tents.</p>

<p>The 22d of <i>August</i>, in the Morning, the Ship's Company catched
some Cod; they were but small, but fine full Fish. The Whaleboat
was sent up with some Hands, to sound and find a Harbour: And three
Persons went on Shore to a high Summit, about four Miles off, to view
the Country: Saw in their Way many Tracts of Deer, a deep Soil, good
Grass, and met with several large level Spots, with Ponds of Water;
thick Groves of Timber, and a plentiful Herbage. The Country, from
this Summit, appeared to consist of Ridges and Mountains; and as the
Weather changed from fine and pleasant, to thick and hazey, they saw
the Clouds settle on several Ridges of the Mountain, near them, as also
on the Heighth where they were, and under them. And when they returned
the People on board said they had had some smart Showers of
Rain, which those who had been on the Heighth were not sensible of.</p>

<p>In the Afternoon they proceeded with the Schooner to a Harbour
which those who had been sent out with the Whaleboat had discovered,
an extraordinary fine Harbour; and it may be here observed in general,
that most of the Harbours are very fine ones. There are many of them,
and not far the one from the other.</p>

<p>There were on the Shore, in many Places, the Remainder of <i>Eskemaux</i>
Encampments, but some Time since they had been there. Timbers of
Boats, on the Shores, which were much decayed, had laid long in the
Weather; in the Carpenter's Opinion the Boats they had belonged to
must have been built fifteen or twenty Years, seemed to be the Timbers
of such Boats as had been seen with the <i>Eskemaux</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>The succeeding Day there was such Weather as they could not proceed;
the Day after, the 25th, run up the Inlet about eight Leagues
from the Harbour, which was about eighteen Leagues from the Entrance
of the Inlet. As they proceeded they found the Country more level,
thick Woods, intermixed with Birch Trees, and both Shores afforded a
pleasant Verdure. They could not proceed further with the Schooner,
by Reason of Falls; which, being surveyed the next Day, might be
passed with the Schooner, but with some Difficulty. Therefore early in
the Morning of the 27th, at a proper Time of Tide, when the Falls
were level, a Party went in a Whaleboat, with a small Boat in tow
loaded with Provisions, Bedding, and a Sail for a Tent, to explore the
Head of the Inlet. The furthest they could get with the Boat was about
five Leagues, being intercepted by impassable Falls, about 300 Feet in
Length, and forty Feet their perpendicular Height, though of gradual
Descent. The Fall Rocks, but the Bank of the Northern Shore, which was
steep, was a Kind of Marl, without any Mixture of Stone; and no frozen
Earth here, or in any other Part, usual in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, as was proved by
repeated Experiments: Therefore it may be concluded that this is a
more temperate Climate in Winter than in any Part about <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay,
in the same or lower Latitudes.</p>

<p>From the first Falls to the second there were large Levels along Shore,
the Mountains at a considerable Distance within Land, especially those
on the North Side. The Mountains and Shores thick cloathed with
Pine, Spruce, Birch, and Alder, much larger and of better Growth
than those Trees nearer the Sea Coast; some Pines measured twenty-five
Inches in Diameter. In a Pond, on the North Shore, saw two Beaver
Houses, and there were Plenty of Beaver Marks, as Dams, Trees barked
and felled by them. The Water was fresh between the first and second
Falls. Poles of <i>Indian</i> Tents in many Places along Shore, Lodgments
only for single Families, tied together with Strips of Deer Skin, and
no Encampments after the <i>Eskemaux</i> Manner, shewed that a different <i>Indians</i>
from the <i>Eskemaux</i> resorted into this Part. The whole Country
had a pleasant Appearance; but as they came near to the upper Falls,
the Verdure of the Woods, barren Points of Rocks that exalted themselves,
terminating the View, the Disposition of the Woods which had
all the Regularity of Art, joined to the Freedom of Nature, the Gloom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
of the Evening, the slow steady Course of the Water, and the Echoes of
the rumbling Fall, afforded such a Scene as affected even those that
rowed; and they said, it was the pleasantest Place they had ever seen.
On a level Point, beautifully green, situated at a small Distance from
an Opening in the Woods, and in full View of and Hearing of the Falls,
there were the Poles of an <i>Indian</i> Tent, which, from the Ashes scarce
cold, a Breast-bone of a wild Goose, with some little Meat on it that had
been broiled, Pieces of Birch Bark left, seemed to have been not long
deserted, and the Situation was such as expressed the late Inhabitants
to have the softest Sensations. In coming up the Inlet they had found
where there had been a small Fire made, as supposed, to dress Victuals,
but put out or covered with Turf, a usual Practice amongst Southern
<i>Indians</i> to conceal the Smoke, when they suppose the Enemy is near.
The Boats were securely harboured, a Tent erected, with a good Fire
before it, and the People rested securely all Night.</p>

<p>The next Day, <i>August</i> the 28th, two Persons were detached to a Summit,
in Appearance about twelve Miles off, others went and hung Strings
of Beads, Combs, Knives, and other Peltry, on the Trees, some at a
Mile, and others at a further Distance, from where they kept their
Camp all Day, to invite the <i>Indians</i> to a Converse with them; but no
<i>Indians</i> were seen, nor any Thing meddled with. Those who had walked
to take the View from the Summit, saw the Water above the Falls extend
a great Distance into the Country, but not the Termination of it,
passing through Meadow Lands of large Dimensions, and by the Foot of
small rising Land, they saw a large high Ridge of blue Mountains at a
great Distance, running North and South, which was supposed to be the
Bounds of the new discovered Sea in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay: Saw several other
Ridges of Land, but seemingly more level than those to Seaward; passed
over in travelling several Spots of excellent Soil, the Timber of good
Size and Growth. There was a great Plenty of Grass and Herbage;
walked a great Way in an <i>Indian</i> Path, and saw several marked Trees,
as is practised amongst the Southern <i>Indians</i>. They returned in the
Evening, much fatigued with the Heat of the Sun, and swelled with
the Bites of Musquetoes, and a small black Fly, like those in <i>England</i>
called a Midge. Those that staid at the Encampment were also much
plagued with these Insects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>The Latitude of the upper Falls was 54 Deg. 48 Min. near the imaginary
Line that bounded the <i>English</i> and <i>French</i> Limits in these Parts;
and it being supposed that the two Inlets, seen from the Height above
the Harbour where they first anchored, would terminate in the <i>French</i>
Limits; they therefore had declined making any Search there, and proceeded
to search the Inlet to Northward.</p>

<p>The next Morning they set out to return to the Schooner, with a
Design to search the other Inlet to Northward, seen from the Mountain
at the Back of the first Harbour, but not seen since by Reason of a
high Ridge of Mountains, as it was supposed, that covered it. In the
Night there had been a sharp Frost, and early in the Morning a thick
Fog. About Ten in the Morning they were returned to the Schooner.
Several of the People, contrary to the written Instructions which were
left, had rambled from the Vessel, got on the Heights, rolled down the
<i>Indian</i> Marks, which are Stones that they put up one on another on
the Knolls and Summits of Hills, to direct them in their journeying; a
Proceeding which was highly dissatisfactory to the Commander, considering
the Disposition which it was found the Natives were in, and
whom, with the greatest Industry, they could not get a Sight of. The
People had shot some few Fowl, which were plentier in this Inlet than
any where that they had seen, but very shy and wild. They sailed that
Afternoon to the Harbour which they were at when they first entered
this Inlet.</p>

<p><i>August</i> the 29th they sailed out of this Inlet to go to the Northward,
keeping within a Ledge of Islands, as they might pass no Part of the
Coast unsearched. Met with some Difficulties amongst the Shoals and
Rocks; but about Four in the Afternoon were clear of all, and plyed to
Windward to enter the third or more Northern Inlet, which they had
now open. Saw at the Head of a pretty deep Cove, on the South Side
in that Inlet, a strong Smoke arise, and that immediately answered by a
lesser Smoke on the Northern Side of the Inlet. The Smoke on the
Northern Side the Inlet continued towering and freshening; on seeing
which they immediately steered for the Cove, supposing the Smoke
to be made by the Natives as a Signal for Trade; but were delayed entering
by the Tide of Ebb. At Sunset were surprised with a Squall of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Wind, which came on in a Moment, and the Schooner in extreme Danger
of being ashore on the Rocks. A hard Gale succeeded, but they
fortunately attained a Harbour, which had been before discovered by the
Boat, and rode secure.</p>

<p>The 31st of <i>August</i>, the Weather being moderate, two Persons went
over the Heights to the Head of the Cove, in Pursuit of the Natives;
and three Persons went in a Boat to the Head of the Cove, with some
trading Goods, and to pass the two who walked, over the Water if it
ran up into the Country, and the Natives should be on the opposite
Shore; but after rowing up about two Leagues they found a Termination
of the Water, landed and ascended the Heights, where they found
a very large Plain, without Ponds, and a fine Soil, which they passed
over and descended into a Valley, thick Groves, good Grass, and large
Ponds. Here they met with a Bear; which one of the People firing too
precipitately missed. Several Bears had been seen before, some Foxes,
many Tracts of Wolves, both on the Shores and Inland, and in one
Place Otter Paths.</p>

<p>Three of the People were sent to return with the Boat aboard, and
two set out to go up a Mountain which promised a good Sight of the
Country, and seemed possible that they might attain to the Summit of
it, and return to the Schooner that Night; but were deceived by the
Height of the Mountain as to the Distance they were from it. In the
Ascent they found great Declivities and Hollows in the Sides of the
Mountain, the Rocks rent in a most surprising Manner, having Rents or
Fissures in them from thirty to seventy Feet in Depth; some tremendous
to look down, and not above two or three Feet in Breadth. The Dogs
that were with them would not, after looking down, jump over them,
but howled and took a Sweep round. In the Levels and Hollows on
the Side there lay great Heaps of fallen Rock. Some Stones or solid
Pieces of ten or fifteen Tons Weight, besides innumerable lesser Pieces.
And found a Patch of Snow in one of the Hollows, about forty Feet in
Breadth, and fourteen Feet in perpendicular Height, frozen solid, and
seemed of the same Consistence with the Islands of Ice. The Persons,
though constantly labouring, did not attain to the Top of the Mountain
until about Half an Hour before Sunset, where they found a thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Air, and a fresh sharp cold Wind; though below, and in their Ascent,
they had experienced pleasant warm Weather, and little Wind. From
the Mountain they perceived a Smoke, about ten Miles off more inland,
the usual Practice of the <i>Indians</i> in the Evenings, when they form
their Camps, to make a Fire to dress their Provisions, and to be by all
Night; and it was then suspected that they were flying more inland,
and that the Smokes seen the Night before were Signals from one Party
to another to retire on seeing the Schooner, supposing us Enemies. It
was too late that Night to return to the Head of the Cove, therefore encamped
that Night on the Side of the Mountain in the Woods, near to
a level Spot without the least Unevenness of above six Hundred Feet in
Breadth, and three Hundred over, exactly resembling a Pavement without
any Fissure or Opening in it. The next Day got to the Head of the
Cove, near twelve Miles from the Mountain; on a Signal made the
Boat fetched them aboard, where the People expressed in their Countenances
a universal Joy at seeing their Commander safe returned, which
was a great Satisfaction to him, as it was an Instance more sincerely expressed
than by formal Words addressed to him, that they looked on
their Security to depend on his Preservation. The Wind was contrary
to their getting out of the Harbour that Afternoon; but the Boats were
employed in seeking the best Channel for the Schooner to go out at.</p>

<p>The Morning of <i>September</i> the 2d, the Wind proved favourable, and
that Evening they got a good Way up the third Inlet. When they were
some Way up the Inlet, they discovered a Smoke upon an Island at the
Entrance of the Inlet, and, when at Anchor, a Smoke also on the North
Shore. Therefore by Day-light, <i>September</i> the 3d, the Time when
Smokes are most discernable and looked out for by the <i>Indians</i>, a Person
was sent to fire the Brush on an Eminence ashore, to answer that Smoke
seen on the North Shore the Night before. Then the Schooner proceeded
up the Inlet, and by Ten o'Clock was come to the Extremity of
it, which terminated in a Bay of very deep Water, surrounded by very
steep Mountains, with Groves of Trees on them; but they found a good
Anchorage in a Cove, and an excellent Harbour. The Heights being
ascended, it was perceived there was a narrow Streight out of this Inlet,
which communicated with Ponds. And that there was a fourth Inlet to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Northward, and which extended further to Westward than the Inlet which
the Vessel was now in, and about four Miles off, beyond the Hills there
appeared a towering Smoke, upon the Sight of which the Persons who
went to take the View returned aboard to get some Provisions, and a
Parcel of trading Goods, and set out again with an Intention to seek
the Natives, and spend the Night amongst them. The Boat put them
ashore where it was thought most convenient and nearest Place to the
Smoke, but it proved otherwise; for after travelling about three Miles
they fell in with a Chain of Ponds, which they were forced to go round.
Hot sultry Weather, the Woods thick, without the least Breath of Wind,
infinite Number of Musquetoes and Midges. But by being thus to go
round the Ponds, had the Satisfaction of seeing several Beavers Dams
made to keep out the Tide Waters. They saw a Continuance of the
Smoke, and shaped a Course for it; but when on the Heights perceived
that the Smoke was on an Island about two Miles off the Shore in the
fourth Inlet, therefore returned to the Vessel that Night.</p>

<p>The 4th of <i>September</i>, in the Morning, they towed out of the Harbour
they were in, the Wind soon after sprung up, and by Night they go
out of the Inlet, and anchored amongst some Islands, just at the Entrance
of the fourth Inlet.</p>

<p>The next Morning, <i>September</i> the 5th, entered the fourth Inlet; but
being becalmed a small Time catched above fifty Cod, much such as
they had before taken. By Twelve o'Clock were abreast of the Island
where they had seen the Smoke on the 3d, and which was four
Leagues from the Entrance: Could perceive no Natives, but several
Fires, and that there had been a great burning of the Brush; soon after
saw a Snow lying at an Anchor, which hoisted <i>English</i> Colours, and fired
a Gun. They hoisted the Colours aboard the Schooner, fired a Swivel,
and bore away for the Snow. The Wind was fresh, and, as the Schooner
was entering the Harbour, two People came running over the Rocks,
hailed, but it could not be well understood what they said; but it was
a friendly Precaution as to some Rocks which lay off there. The Snow's
People then took to their Boat, and made a Trip to view the Schooner
as she was coming to an Anchor, and then returned aboard. A Whaleboat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
was hoisted out, and a Person sent in it to go aboard the Snow,
and know where she was from, and to let the Captain know they would
be glad to see him aboard the Schooner.</p>

<p>The Person sent, and Capt. <i>Elijah Goff</i> the Commander of the Snow,
returned aboard in a short Time; and the Particulars of what the Captain
related were, That the Snow was fitted out by Mr. <i>Nesbit</i>, a Merchant
in <i>London</i>: That he, the present Captain, had been the Year before
Mate of the same Vessel on this Coast: That she was then fitted
out by <i>Bell, Nesbit</i> and Company; the intended Voyage kept a great Secret.
They had, the Year before as a Captain, a <i>Dane</i> who had used
the <i>Greenland</i> Trade, and could talk the <i>Eskemaux</i> Language. That the
Snow had been at <i>Newfoundland</i>, and afterwards came on the <i>Labrador</i>
Coast; but being Strangers to the Coast, and the Captain very obstinate,
the Vessel was several Times in Danger, which raised a Mutiny amongst
the People, who had formed a Resolution of seizing the Ship, and bearing
away for <i>Newfoundland</i>; which Mutiny was appeased, and the People
consented to go to the <i>Labrador</i>, where they harboured <i>July</i> the
20th, in the same Harbour which the Schooner first entered this Year.
They brought with them four of the <i>Unitas Fratrum</i>, or <i>Moravian</i> Brethren,
who were to remain during the Winter, to attain an Acquaintance
with the Natives, and lay a Foundation of Trade: That the House,
the Ruins of which the Discoverer saw, was built for the Residence of
these Brethren; and, being compleated by the Beginning of <i>September</i>,
the Snow left them in Possession of it, and set out to make Discoveries,
and pursue a Trade to Northward: That they had some Trade in <i>Nesbit</i>'s
Harbour, the Name they had given to the Harbour where the House
was, and also on the Coast before they arrived at the Harbour: That
when they went to Northward; in about Lat. 55° 40´ off the Islands,
amongst which the Schooner had harboured the preceding Night, some
<i>Eskemaux</i> came aboard, and told the <i>Dane</i> Captain there were some trading
Boats come from the Northward, with Plenty of Trade, and advised
the Captain to come where they were. The Captain asked, Why
they would not come along Side? The <i>Eskemaux</i> said, It was dangerous
on Account of the Surf. The Captain and six others went in the Ship's
Boat, with a Quantity of Goods to trade, but had no Fire Arms with
them, though advised to take them; but the Captain said, No, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
were very honest Fellows. Captain <i>Goff</i> saw the Boat go round an
Island, upon which there was a Number of Natives; but the Island hindered
him from having any further Sight of the Boat. After the Boat
had been gone about an Hour, he saw one or two of the <i>Eskemaux</i> with
his Glass peep over the Rocks; but never after saw any more of the
Boat, the Snow's People, or the <i>Eskemaux</i>. That the Snow lay at a
League Distance from the Island; he had no other Boat, one being left
with the <i>Moravian</i> Brethren. Capt. <i>Goff</i> waited three Days, and then
returned with the Snow to the Harbour where the House was. The Snow
being short of Hands, he took the <i>Moravian</i> Brethren aboard, leaving a
Quantity of Provisions sufficient to subsist the unhappy People who
were missing should they come there, until his Return. They put the
Key of the House and a Letter in a Hole of a Tree; but on his Return
this Year found the House in Ruins, the Casks and Hogsheads
broke to Pieces, and the Key and Letter gone. That what was sowed
there was by Way of Experiment.</p>

<p>Capt. <i>Goff</i> judged that the <i>Eskemaux</i> traded with the <i>French</i>, as their
Fishgiggs, Knives, and Boats, were <i>French</i>; and the <i>Eskemaux</i> told them
there was a Settlement of twenty <i>Europeans</i> to Southward, which they
supposed to be somewhere to Southward of Lat. 55, the Latitude of the
Cape they had named Cape <i>Harrison</i>, which is the Southermost Cape
that forms the Bay in which is <i>Nesbit</i>'s Harbour, and the high Saddleback
Land within, which is first seen off at Sea they named <i>St. John</i>'s.
He said that one of the <i>Eskemaux</i> offered a Quantity of Whalebone for
a Cutlass, which they are very fond of; the <i>Danish</i> Captain insisted on
having more, the <i>Eskemaux</i> answered, If he would not take it that Capt.
<i>Saleroo</i> would; alluding, as supposed, to the Captain or Factor at the
<i>French</i> Settlement. The Boats the <i>Eskemaux</i> had were <i>French</i>: They
spoke many <i>French</i> Words. And the Women worked the Boats, turned
them to Windward, and were very expert in the Management of them.</p>

<p>The Account given by the Master who went in the Schooner's Boat
to fish for Cod (Capt. <i>Goff</i> not having yet got any) to the People in
the Boat was, That Mr. <i>Nesbit</i> was only, in this Case, an Agent or Factor
for the <i>Moravian</i> Brethren, who aimed at a Settlement in these Parts,
and to attain a Propriety by a prior Possession, but that no Propriety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
would be allowed of by our Government: That Petitions had been flung into
the Board of Trade for Patents for the <i>Labrador</i>, but were
rejected, and a free Trade would be permitted to all the Subjects of
<i>Great Britain</i>; which open Trade was the original Design on which this
Discovery was undertaken by the People in <i>America</i>; the Execution of
which was not only interrupted by private Persons stealing the Scheme,
and being before hand, but hath been a great Hindrance to the Fisheries
being carried on in those Parts, a Trade established with the inland <i>Indians</i>
and the <i>Eskemaux</i>, and further Advantages which will be known,
on our being better acquainted with those Parts. For as to this Severity
of the <i>Eskemaux</i>, inexcusably barbarous, yet there were some Provocations
which might have been avoided, and which incited those <i>Eskemaux</i>
to this Act, whose Hatred and Revenge, the Character of most
<i>Indians</i>, are rouzed at the slightest Causes. It appears from a Journal of
the Boatswain, wherein he makes a Valuation of the Trade, that they
had bought a Hundred Weight of Whalebone for Six-pence. The <i>Eskemaux</i>
were also treated with great Contempt and Rudeness. A Person
aboard had bought a Pair of <i>Eskemaux</i> Boots; and carrying them into his
Cabbin, an <i>Eskemaux</i> followed claiming the Boots as his, saying that he
who sold them had no Right to sell them; and the Buyer settled the
Matter by presenting a Pistol at his Head. On which the <i>Eskemaux</i> cried
out in the <i>French</i>, <i>Tout</i>, <i>Comerado</i>, and retired.</p>

<p>Capt. <i>Goff</i> came this Year in Hopes to recover the People who were
missing with the Boat, and to make a further Essay as to the Trade,
but brought no Settlers with him, intended immediately for the Coast,
which he could not attain to on Account of the Ice, and went to <i>Trinity</i>
Bay in <i>Newfoundland</i>, where he staid some Time. Sailed from thence
the 27th of <i>June</i>; the 2d of <i>July</i> saw <i>French</i> Ships in the Streights of
<i>Belle Isle</i>, retarded by the Ice; and the 9th of <i>July</i> joined Capt. <i>Taylor</i>
in a Sloop of about 35 Tons, fitted out from <i>Rhode Island</i> to go in Pursuit
of a <i>North-west Passage</i>; and if not successful to come down on
the Coast of <i>Labrador</i>. Capt. <i>Goff</i> said he had learned by Capt. <i>Taylor</i>
that the <i>Philadelphia</i> Schooner would be out, and he should have suspected
this to be her, but she entered the Inlet so readily, and came up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
with that Boldness as could not but think that the Schooner was a <i>French</i>
Vessel acquainted with the Coast; and he had received Orders to avoid
any Harbour in which a <i>French</i> Ship should appear. Capt. <i>Taylor</i> had
seen a large <i>French</i> Sloop in Latitude 53, and to the Northward three
hundred <i>Eskemaux</i>, who had nothing to trade but their old Cloaths,
and who were going further to Northward, but were hindered by the
Ice. Capt. <i>Goff</i> and <i>Taylor</i>, who had entered into an Agreement to
associate, were eight Days grappled to the Ice, and did not arrive at
<i>Nesbit</i>'s Harbour until the 20th of <i>July</i>. But had traded with some of
the <i>Eskemaux</i> before, though for small Matters, and had some of these
<i>Eskemaux</i> aboard for three successive Days, who then left them, and
came no more aboard the Vessels. Capt. <i>Goff</i> suspected, though he had
altered his Dress, that they had then recollected him. The 1st of <i>August</i>
they sailed from <i>Nesbit</i>'s Harbour, and attained to this Inlet where
he now was; and on the 11th sailed to the Northward, when Capt.
<i>Taylor</i> left him; and on the 25th returned here again. That the Smoke
which the Persons saw on the Island when they travelled over Land,
and which the Schooner passed that Day, was made by his Order, but
that he had not made any other Smoke, and this was for a Direction for
his Longboat, gone to the Northward to trade, and to signify to Capt.
<i>Taylor</i> his being in the Harbour, whose Return he expected.</p>

<p>Capt. <i>Goff</i> said he had been in no Inlet but <i>Nesbit</i>'s Harbour, and in
this where the Snow was; and that Capt. <i>Taylor</i>, in the Snow's Longboat,
had searched the Head of this Inlet, shewed a Draught of the
Coast, which was defective, as he knew nothing of the intermediate Inlets.
Had no Account of the inland Country; of there being any Beaver
or other Furs to be acquired there; or of there being any Mines, of
which the Schooner's People had seen many Instances, and had collected
some Ore. Capt. <i>Goff</i> had two <i>Dutch</i> Draughts of the Coast, made
from late Surveys; but they were very inaccurate, the Views taken
from Sea, and there the Land appeared close and continued; the Inlets,
excepting that in which they now were, appearing like small Bays,
their Entrance being covered by Islands. They had, this Year, found
the Corpse of one of those who went in the Boat, stripped and lying
on an island.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>It being rainy Weather, and the Wind contrary to the Schooner's
going up the Inlet, they were detained, and on <i>September</i> the 8th the
Snow's Longboat returned, after having been out fourteen Days, with
some Whalebone, and a Quantity of <i>Eskemaux</i> Cloathing, which being
examined to find out if the <i>Eskemaux</i> wore Furs, there was only seen a
small Slip of Otter Skin on one of the Frocks. And Capt. <i>Goff</i>, being
asked, said he never saw any Furs amongst them. It is pretty evident
the <i>Eskemaux</i> only pass along this Coast, to go and trade with the <i>Eskemaux</i>
in <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights, and occasionally put in as Weather or other
Occasions may make it necessary, which keeps the Native or inland <i>Indians</i>
from the Coast, as they are their Enemies. The <i>Eskemaux</i> go up
to Latitude 58, or further North; there leave their great Boats, pass a
small Neck of Land, taking their Canoes with them, and then go into
another Water which communicates with <i>Hudson</i>'s Streights. Carry
their Return of Trade into <i>Eskemaux</i> Bay, where they live in Winter; and
the <i>French</i> made considerable Returns to <i>Old France</i>, by the Whalebone
and Oil procured from these People. And this Account is agreeable to
the best Information that could be procured.</p>

<p>While the Schooner's People were viewing the Cloaths, Word was
brought that the <i>Eskemaux</i> were coming, who may be heard shouting almost
before that they can be discerned, the Schooner's People repaired
aboard. On the Colours aboard the Snow being hoisted, the Schooner's
People displayed theirs; but the Snow being the nearest, and the Snow's
People so urged the <i>Eskemaux</i> to come along-side them, that they were
afraid to pass. The <i>Eskemaux</i> had no large Boats with them, only their
Canoes, three of which came afterwards along-side the Schooner. It
was perceived that none of the leading People were in the Canoes; they
exposed no Marks or Shew of any Trade they had, which was usual for
them to lay on the Outside their Canoes; nevertheless they were presented
with Rings. It was some Time before they began to trade with
the Snow's People, and then it was carried on in a very peremptory
Manner.</p>

<p>The People in the Schooner, a light Wind springing up, weighed Anchor,
with a Design to proceed up the Inlet, expecting to be followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
by the <i>Eskemaux</i>, when they saw that they were not Associates with the
Snow's People, so to have a future Opportunity of trading with them.
It was also consistent with the Design they had of searching this Inlet,
the first Opportunity that offered. They took their Leave of Capt. <i>Goff</i>
as they passed, and when advanced further beat their Drum. The
<i>Eskemaux</i> quitted the Snow and came after the Schooner. The Fire
Arms were all primed and in order aboard the Schooner, but concealed;
each Man had his Station; and they were ordered to treat the <i>Eskemaux</i>
as Men, and to behave to them in an orderly Manner; no hallooing,
jumping, or wrestling with them when they came aboard; not to refuse
some of the <i>Eskemaux</i> to come aboard, and let others, as there were but
nine Canoes in all.</p>

<p>As the <i>Eskemaux</i> came along-side the Schooner, they were presented
each with a Biscuit, a Person standing in the main Chains with a Basket
of Biscuit for that Purpose. Then they aboard the Schooner shewed a
Kettle, a Hatchet, and some other Things, which seemed much to
please the <i>Eskemaux</i>. One of them attempting to get into the Schooner,
two of the People helped him in: He was received civilly on the Quarter-deck;
the trading Box shewed him, a Spoon, a Knife, and a Comb
with which he touched his Hair and seemed desirous of, were given him.
Other <i>Eskemaux</i> were by this Time aboard. They were presented with
Fish-hooks, small Knives, Combs, and a King <i>George</i>'s Shilling apiece,
which they carefully put into their Sleeves. In the interim the <i>Eskemaux</i>
who came first aboard was gone to the Side, and called to another yet
in the Canoe under the Title of <i>Capitaine</i>. The <i>Eskemaux</i> so called to immediately
came aboard, saluted the Commander with three Congees,
and kissed each Cheek. He was presented with a Spoon and a Knife.
Being shewn the Goods, appeared very desirous of a File, offering old
Cloaths for it. But the Commander signified he would not trade for
old Cloaths, but <i>Shoeeock</i> (which is Whalebone in their Language) or
Skins; and the latter he denoted to the <i>Capitaine</i> by a Piece of white
Bear Skin that the <i>Capitaine</i> had brought in his Hand. The <i>Capitaine</i>
expressed by his Action that he had not either Bone or Skins: He was
then presented with the File; was shewed a Matchcoat, which he surveyed
very accurately; signed to the Commander if he was not come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
round from the South-west, meaning, as supposed, from <i>Quebeck</i> or the
Gulph of <i>St. Lawrence</i>. Afterwards took the Commander under his
Arm, and shewed a Desire of going into the Cabbin, which was complied
with. He passed the Door first, and sat down in as regular a
Manner as any <i>European</i>, having first accurately looked about him; but
there were no Fire-Arms in Sight. Refused Wine, drank Spruce Beer;
was shewed a Sample of all the Kind of Goods, with which he seemed
well pleased; and it was signified to him that there was Plenty of them.
While in the Cabbin the other <i>Eskemaux</i> who were on Deck, called to
their <i>Capitaine</i>, they were invited down. Three of the <i>Eskemaux</i> came,
but it was observable the <i>Capitaine</i> covered the Goods with a Woollen
Cloth, which lay on the Table. They were presented with Beef and
Pudding, which they took, and returned on Deck. The <i>Eskemaux Capitaine</i>
put the Goods into the Box himself very honestly, and seeming
to admire a small Brass-handled Penknife, it was presented to him. He
then returned on Deck, pointed to the Sun, lowered his Hand a little,
then made a Sign of sleeping by shutting his Eyes, and laying his Hand
to his Cheek, and shewed with his Hand to have the Schooner to come
to an Anchor just above. By which it was understood that a little after
that Time the next Day he would be there with Trade. The Schooner,
being by this Time opposite to a narrow Passage or Streight formed by
Islands, through which the <i>Eskemaux</i> had come into this Inlet, the <i>Capitaine</i>
ordered his People into their Canoes, and retired with a Congee
himself, after repeating the Commander's Name, to see if he had it
right, and which he had been very industrious to learn while he was in
the Cabbin. The Commander attended him to the Side; and seeing in
his Canoe a War-bow and Arrows, which are of a curious Construction,
pressed him to let him have them, though the same Thing as asking a
Man to part with the Sword he wore. The <i>Capitaine</i>, by Signs, shewed
he could not part with it, and seemed to express it with great Reluctance
that he could not. This Circumstance, and their having no Women
with them, caused the Schooner's People to think they looked
upon themselves, when they set out, as coming amongst their Enemies.
The Drum was beat until they were out of Sight; and the <i>Capitaine</i>,
just before he lost Sight of the Schooner by being shut in by the Islands,
pointed to the Sun, and the anchoring Place. The <i>Eskemaux</i>, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
aboard, behaved with great Decency and Silence; though at first they began
to jump and halloo, as they had done aboard the Snow; but finding
the People of the Schooner not so disposed, soon left off.</p>

<p>Soon after the Schooner was anchored in an excellent Harbour, the
Snow's Boat came along-side, with the first Mate and Agent. They
were asked to mess; and it being enquired of them how far they had
been with the Longboat in the last Trip, said to Latitude 57° 14´:
Had seen no <i>Eskemaux</i>, but within a few Days, though they had been
out fourteen Days. The Mate said, that he had chased a trading Boat,
with two <i>Eskemaux</i> in it, who had endeavoured to avoid them, and
dodged amongst the Islands; but he came up with them as though he
had been a Privateer's Boat; run bolt aboard them, and so frightened
the <i>Eskemaux</i> that they fell on their Knees, cried out, <i>Tout Comerado</i>,
and they would have given him all they had. He said they took out the
Whalebone, which he brought aboard, about a Hundred and fifty
Weight, and paid them for it as much as he saw the Captain give. He
saw other <i>Eskemaux</i> at times ashore, where they invited him, but would
not venture; and fired a Blunderbuss, charged with thirteen Bullets,
over them, which caused some of them to fall down, others to bow.
Some <i>Eskemaux</i> came along-side, and traded their Cloaths; but with great
Fear, crying out, <i>Tout Comerado</i>, as he had four Men armed standing
in the Bow of the Boat. Said that those <i>Eskemaux</i> had, who were just
gone from the Schooner, the Peoples Cloaths who had been trepanned
the last Year, particularly a brown Waistcoat, which had had white Buttons
on it, and a white Great-coat. The Great-coat meant was a <i>French</i>
Matchcoat, which the <i>Eskemaux</i> Captain had on, made up in a Frock
according to the Manner that they wear them. The supposed brown
Jacket was a <i>French</i> brown Cloth, and there were two <i>Eskemaux</i> who
had them. The Mate said the Schooner's People had talked of some
Inlets; but no Answer was made, on which he declared there was no
Inlet between <i>Nesbit</i>'s Harbour and where they then were, nor any Inlet
to Northward between that and Latitude 57° 14´. After making some
Enquiries, as to what the Schooner's People further intended, quitted,
and made for the Streight the <i>Eskemaux</i> had passed through.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>This is mentioned as an Instance of what Caution should be used,
as to the Choice of Persons sent on Expeditions to explore unfrequented
or unknown Parts, as the Adventurers may be Sufferers, and the Reason
of their being so a Secret, and thereon pronounce decisively no Advantages
are to be made, thus deprived of what might be greatly to their
private Emolument in Time under a proper Conduct, and to the Benefit
of the Publick. And there is a further Misfortune attending an
improper Choice, which every social and generous Man will consider.
That according to the Impressions that <i>Indians</i> receive on the first Acquaintance,
a lasting Friendship may be expected, or an Enmity and
Jealousy very difficult to remove, who, in the interim, will execute their
Revenge; not on those who gave the Offence, but on all indiscriminately
of the same Complexion, when an Opportunity offers. Reasons
would be unnecessarily urged in Support of what Experience proves,
and of which there have been several melancholy Examples on this
Coast. By a Privateer from <i>New York</i>, some Years since, the first Offence
was given; those who have gone since have done nothing to mollify
or abate this Enmity and Revenge. There could be no Expectation
of a Reconciliation with these <i>Indians</i>, to the great Improvement of
Commerce in various Branches, but by the Measures taken, the sending
some of his Majesty's Ships into these Parts to explore and get a Knowledge
of the Coast; and the Commanders to establish a Regulation,
which will be a Satisfaction and Encouragement to every fair Trader;
and where the Trade long since might have been brought to some Perfection,
had it not been from the little dirty Avarice of those employed
by private Adventurers, who hindered the original Design having a due
Effect; and by interfering the one with the other, to their mutual Prejudice,
they prevented those Returns on their Voyages which might have
been otherwise made. The Consequence was, all future Attempts were
dropt, and it was indeed rendered almost impossible that any fresh Undertakings
should meet with Success, by the Difficulties flung in the
Way on Account of the Natives, but which will now be effectually removed
by the Government giving their Assistance.</p>

<p>The next Morning three People were sent from the Schooner to go on
the Heights, to discover the Water the <i>Eskemaux</i> had gone into, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
see if the <i>Eskemaux</i> were coming. The Account brought back was,
that there was seen an <i>Indian</i> trading Boat or Shallop under Sail, which
presently tacked and stood towards four other Shallops. They all lowered
Sail, and the <i>Eskemaux</i> seemed to be consulting together. Soon
after the People saw the Snow's Longboat coming, the Shallops hoisted
Sail, then went one Canoe, afterwards two more, to the Snow's Longboat,
while the Shallops crouded away. The Schooner's People, after
this Time, had no Opportunity of seeing the <i>Eskemaux</i>; and attributed
their coming no more to their Fear of meeting the Longboat, or the
bad Weather, it being wet and blustering for the several succeeding
Days. But they learned, after the Schooner had returned to <i>Philadelphia</i>,
that those in the Snow's Longboat followed the Shallops, came up with
them, and took what they had. The Reason is apparent for their not
coming to the Schooner as they had no Trade, and as they might have
a Suspicion that the Schooner's People had a Connivance with those in
the Boat, especially as they might see the three People from the Schooner
standing on the Heights.</p>

<p>The Commander searched the Head of this Inlet, the Shores of which
were the most barren of any that had yet been seen, from the Sea to the
Head of it, about nine Leagues. Upon their Return they found the
Snow gone; they then went through the Streight by which they saw the
<i>Eskemaux</i> pass to explore that Water. From this the Discoverer passed
between Islands, without going out to Sea into a second Inlet; and from
that to a third from where he had met the Snow, and the seventh from <i>Nesbit</i>'s
Harbour. And the seventh or last Inlet ran a North and Westerly
Course, and terminated the furthest inland, or had the most Western
Longitude of any of the Inlets; and its Head about fifteen Leagues
from the Sea.</p>

<p>These last three Inlets to Seaward are separated by very large Islands,
and have Islands lying off directly athwart their Entrance, so that it is
difficult to discover, when within these Islands, that there is any Outlet to
the Sea. The Islands have little Wood on them, and are mostly barren
Rock; but the main Land much as in the other Parts, only the Inland
more level. The blue Ridge of Mountains appeared plainer than from
any other Part. The Latitude of the furthest Inlet about 56.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>Having explored these respective Waters and adjacent Country, and
<i>Davis</i>'s Inlet, consequently, though it is difficult to which properly to
affix the Name; and the Autumn being far advanced, as was apparent
from the Birch Leaves becoming yellow, the Berries Frost-bit, the Pines
and Spruce turning brown, severe Gales, Snow and Sleet at times, and
excessive cold on the high Land; so as nothing further could be carried
on with any Spirit, but excessive Fatigue, and the Health of the People,
as well preserved as on first setting out, would be now impaired, with
no certain Prospect of doing any Thing further that was material, sufficient
Harbours having been found; on the 20th of <i>September</i> they set
out on their Return.</p>

<p>Leaving the Land favoured with pleasant Weather, an Opportunity
waited for to make an accurate Survey of the Fishing Bank, and to find
the Distance it lay from the Land, which from the Soundings on making
the Land, the seeing the Islands of Ice aground, and the Account of
<i>Davis</i>, was known to be there, and named by him <i>Walsingham</i>'s Bank,
after the true Patriot and generous Patron of a Discovery of a North-west
Passage. Sounding about a League from Land, with one Hundred
and fifty Fathom of Line, had no Ground. At about six Leagues from
Land, twenty-five Fathoms afterwards various Soundings, and catched
a great many Cod, large and full fed, reckoned by the People aboard,
to be very extraordinary Fish, some of whom from <i>Boston</i> followed the
Employ of fishing for Cod. The Bank was concluded to be about nine
Leagues broad, and ninety Fathom Soundings on the going off it, on
the Eastern Side; and it was concluded, on a pretty good Assurance,
that it reaches from Lat. 57 to Lat. 54, if not further; but the Weather
proving boisterous, as they ran to the Southward, could not continue
their Soundings.</p>

<p>The Schooner sounded with a Hundred and fifty Fathom of Line,
close by an Island of Ice, of a surprising Magnitude, between the Bank
and the Shore, which was aground, and they did not get Soundings.</p>
